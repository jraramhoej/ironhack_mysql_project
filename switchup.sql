But the bootcamp overall was a good experience, I experienced it in hybrid mode online and I can attend physically, it wasn’t that bad, sometimes annoying for working in groups but it was a super interesting experience, as for the bootcamp gained knowledge, I feel there is room for improvement but doesn’t mean it’s bad, it’s actually very good but still can be improved further and it will be top of the top to be honest, the staff are super super friendly, man I can’t emphasise how good and amazing they were, as a new expat that was very important to me and so were the students, my design squad hopefully we will stay friends for life, the campus man, I want to live there, top tbh top, that’s all pros I guess, I’ll add up some cons shortly but overall I loved the experience and gained knowledge, anyone with previous knowledge, throw that aside and learn from the start then connect, you’ll never learn enough with a half filled cup, empty the cup, learn then mix it up and flood yourself with knowledge. As for me tbh, I come from a design background so the first two weeks was very hard to work with others who knew nothing so be patient we are all there to learn. Another thing is the hybrid mode, I personally loved it, if it’s any problem to you, you can attend there and do online together but if you’re not a fan then wait until it goes back to normal hopefully soon crossed fingers. As for the bootcamp all in all, I would advise people who want such thing and have some problems committing to study on their own specially, this will be good for you, plus you’ll be certified. My only problem tbh, might not be my only one, it is while I’m writing this because just top of my mind, I know it’s long sorry hehe, the money, kind of expensive tbh specially that I got a couple of promotions and I wasn’t allowed to apply them together, some people paid more, some paid less, some didn’t pay at all they got full scholarships, which felt weird to be honest, but alas we were there to learn so doesn’t matter but it would have felt way better if it was a little cheaper than it is now, at least that’s my judgment, I come from another country where salaries are way less and the economy barely equates so might be only me but my opinion haa.

Although the pre-work seemed a lot, I had only started to scratch the surface of what is needed to become a full stack developer. The bootcamp is only 9 weeks long but it felt more like 9 months because if you want to follow the pace you have to dedicate all your time and energy to it (nights and weekends included!). The structure of the bootcamp is as follows: every morning you learn new concepts and skills, every afternoon you do a guided project - called lab - to put the lesson into practice. The labs are challenging and put you in real life work situations so it’s a fantastic way to learn. There are sometimes solo labs, sometimes group labs so you can practice working on your own as well as with a team of developers. At the end of every 2 weeks, you have 1 week to develop a project of your own with a couple of teammates to test your skills and start building your portfolio. During the entire bootcamp you get the support of super skilled teachers. They always look for the right balance between helping you when you get stuck on a problem and letting you find the solution for yourself so that you do not only learn to blindly apply concepts but genuinely understand them. Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Ironhack. Yes, it’s been intense but I could not have learned this much in such a short time with another format.

In January of 2021, I began my journey in an intense boot camp, with the most creative and passionate students and teachers I had ever met. Suddenly, something that seemed impossible, started becoming true. I was understanding, practicing, and becoming well versed in the best design practices and tools.

In a nutshell, Ironhack is the perfect place for everyone and anyone, who desires to start a career in tech.

Career services rock!','2021-03-30',0,5,5,5,5,'I graduated from Ironhack Miami\'s full-time web development bootcamp this March and I can\'t recommend it enough. I was very hesitant at first to join any sort of bootcamp. I looked into it a few years ago and compared them all. I weighed pros and cons... Read More and in the end always thought I could make it without the help of a bootcamp so I just waited and pretended that I would start the job search eventually but two years later I was still unemployed. I got an email from OfferUp announcing their partnership with Ironhack and it piqued my interest. I gave it a shot and won a partial scholarship which was enough to offset the interest fees from the loan. I was also able to get approved for the loan by one of their financing partners despite having a very poor credit score and high credit utilization which was a blessing! As the title of my review says, I had already been programming since I was a teenager. I\'ve worked on several multiplayer game mods and even created games, programs and websites of my own. Being self-taught is great! There was one big drawback however; I could not find a job. My resume was awful, I did not know how to network nor the true importance of networking. I had no clue how to sell myself or how to talk to recruiters. It was obvious to me that joining a bootcamp would not make me gain any significant technical skills considering my extensive background. I already had a fair understanding of the material being taught and could have brushed up those skills within a week or two. So why did I join Ironhack? Simply for the one and only Daniel Brito from Ironhack\'s Career services. Throughout the bootcamp, I was able to schedule one-on-one meetings with him in order to discuss my career goals as well as get advice on how to approach certain companies and very good interview preparation help. I always had so many questions prepared for him yet I only needed to ask him one question and he would predict my next 2-3 questions and answer them in advance. He really knows his stuff! As soon as Brito walked us through updating our LinkedIn profiles, I was assaulted by recruiters left and right and didn\'t know what to do. He pointed me in the right direction, told me what to watch out for and what to expect. He gave me the confidence that I needed to aim high and shoot for the positions I didn\'t see myself achieving for another 5 years. Thanks to his guidance, I landed a job two weeks before graduating as a DevOps engineer for an amazing company who works with what is in my opinion the best tech stack you can have in 2021. Compared to other bootcamps that say you don\'t pay until you get hired (or worse, the ones that take a percentage of your salary!) Ironhack was the only clear viable choice for me. I knew full well going into it that I was there for Brito first and foremost and to make great connections second. I\'ve created some relationships that I hope to carry with me for life not only with fellow students but with my teacher Niko as well. I can\'t say enough about the teacher I had. Honestly I have never seen a teacher so passionate when it comes to his student\'s success. Most teachers would traditionally stop and go MIA as soon as the clock turns over or your time in the bootcamp is up, but not at Ironhack. Niko and I actually started a passion project together which is aimed at helping students stay in touch and keep learning and connecting with others even post-graduation. I think that speaks for itself in the amount of care that goes into your learning experience. You\'ll never feel like you\'re just a number on a spreadsheet that needs to get a grade. If you are in the same situation I was four months ago meaning you are passionate about code, are self taught and have been struggling to enter the professional world or are simply afraid of the financial burden of having to take out a loan, take it from me. I went from earning 16k/year from self-employment income to now earning six figures doing the job I\'ve been dreaming about ever since I was a teenager.

This is very misleading. The placement rate is calculated by dividing the number of employed students / number of students looking for a job. What they don\'t mention is that: out of all the graduates, only 68% are job searching. And their definition of \'employed\' includes Hired-in-field, Hired-out-of-field (!), Ironhack Employee, Freelancer, Internships and Entrepreneurs. In reality, it\'s only 50% of UX/UI Design graduates who get a job within UX/UI Design after 6 months. I graduated several months ago and only a few people out of 20 in my cohort have managed to get a job at this point. Of course covid-19 complicates everything, but I have applied for 140+ jobs (resulting in around 10 interviews), studied theory and completed unpaid internships, and it seems quite hopeless at this point. I recommend reading their number in details here https://www.ironhack.com/en/news/ironhack-student-outcomes-report-audited-by-pwc - Another point that might be implicit when applying for a 10 week bootcamp is that the education is quite shallow. We never learned how to make safe assumptions out of research data. Instead, we angled the research to fit our design idea. This was due to lack of time and lack of knowledge since we never actually learned why we did things on a deeper level. We never got any feedback on our actual design process or design thinking, only on how we presented our design. I think this is a problem since we compete with people with more education and more experience within research and design thinking. - The education was very unstructured which became really stressful. We were already expected to put in 60-70 hours a week, but the teachers rarely managed to keep the time, resulting in a huge stress since we every week had to deliver a product design and a great presentation. ... I will keep applying for jobs and refining my profile, but I would recommend anyone who considers Ironhack to think it through and be a bit skeptical.Read Less','ironhack'),(26,272083,'Valuable investment !','2021-01-09',1,5,5,5,5,'Learning to code from very limited understanding to a fullstack skillset.

The key to learning is to practice as much as you can, so take extra time to code and do the labs.

Read More knowledge, sometimes I felt they lacked it when we asked questions in depth. Our cohort was about 15+ students and we only had one teacher and one TA, who graduated from Ironhack just a few months before, so his knowledge was quite limited, especially for the projects. This was inconvenient because several times we had to wait in line to get someone to help us debug our code (after we spent at least 30 min, if not more, without success). Also, it is super intense and I truly believe that 9 weeks is too short to really learn all that\'s offered in the curriculum and fully understand. Some topics are briefly discussed but they require a lot more of self-study after the bootcamp as in between sessions we\'re too busy with the evening labs (which take hours to solve, trust me).Keep in mind that in the full-time bootcamp, there\'s no day in between each class where you can see deeper some concepts. Every day is super challenging and we\'re moving onto new subjects quickly, so it\'s super important to keep your head out of the water and ask questions until you fully understand, otherwise you will miss a lot of knowledge.The technologies studied are overall good for the current job market except for Mongo DB (non-relational DB) which I wouldn\'t recommend because it\'s a and nowadays relational DB (like mySQL) are more in demand on job offers.Regarding the career week, to me, it sounded like a joke. From their marketing campaigns, it looks like they\'ll arrange for you interviews with companies they have an agreement with (based on their algorithm), but in fact in that week, you basically learn how to make a CV and a cover letter, and they keep repeating to you that you should use your network and that they won\'t help you if you don\'t do your part of the job and complete all the tedious tasks on the student portal.One great thing was the ambiance with the other students and those from other cohorts. Especially during a very intense bootcamp where your brain is overwhelmed, it was nice, even remotely, to get to (virtually) meet up, play games, etc.Overall I don\'t regret the experience of a coding bootcamp because I learned a lot and that gave me a great push for a career in development, but don\'t fool yourself, you need to work a lot more and for many more months before you get a job in development unless you have coding experience prior to the bootcamp.A coding bootcamp is really not for everyone. If you\'re really determined to get a job right after, you better start working months before enrolling.Also, considering the price, I really think it\'s a rip-off (unless you get a substantial scholarship). The price for the on-site bootcamp and the remote one are almost the same which is not justifiable as by learning remotely, you don\'t use any location from Ironhack, you use your own desk, electricity, internet, etc, and even for the events, you\'re bringing your own beer!

Read More more than enough guidance and resources to accomplish my goal of landing a job and making a complete career change. This program is called a \'bootcamp\' for a reason. It is tough and intense. You are learning A LOT each day through lectures and (mostly) project work. However, the instructors are there for you at all times to answer any questions and offer you the proper guidance. The instructors I had were VERY knowledgable about the UX process and best practices, and they were always so patient with those who needed extra time to fully understand the concepts. I never felt intimidated or scared to approach them with any questions or concerns that I had. They created a very inspiring and encouraging classroom environment. Following the examples of our instructors, all of my fellow classmates were always willing to help each other out and pick each other up. By the end of the bootcamp, we had all gotten pretty close and it was honestly hard to say goodbye. Another part of the program I really benefitted from was their Career Services. Brito (the Ironhack Outcomes Manager) is an absolute job and networking guru! Something I really liked about this part was their honesty. They made it clear that if you want to land a job out of this program, then you need to be the one doing the networking and applying. So many bootcamps out there promise that they will hand you a job right out of the program, which is total BS. But Ironhack\'s approach is to teach you the best methods of networking, applying, interviewing, and setting up your LinkedIn. Rather than catching a fish for you, they teach you how to fish. I was able to land a really good Product Design job within a month of graduating. However, landing a job takes some people longer than others. I can honestly say that this program changed my life for the better. I was working in farms and restaurants prior to this, barely getting by on my hourly pay, and now I have landed a permanent role with a great salary and benefits. I am forever grateful for Ironhack and owe them so much. Last but not least I do want to say: this program isn\'t a walk in the park. It is a lot of work and very stressful at times, but this just means that you will be learning a lot of information. Any program worth doing will challenge you to become better.

One of the things I remember reading about (which I kind of doubted before starting) was the friendship everyone said you develop with co-participants, and how tight you become as a group. I was proven wrong. The Ironhack staff of Berlin almost forced us to become good friends! Now now, hear me out. After a first day of introduction games, name games and an already overwhelming amount of work, the participants would go out together and have a drink. And after a hard day\'s work (and on every Friday!) we would do the same. We had pair-programming everyday during classes and did independent projects in pairs or trios. The work is so intense, and you spend so much time with your peers, that by the time the first week is over, it will feel like you\'ve already known the others for a long time. You end up with a sort of us against the work-mentality because of the sheer amount, where you just have to band together to beat the monster that is the Daily Exercise. I feel that I don\'t really need to say much about the effectiveness of Ironhack\'s teaching. I got a job after 1 month. I had zero prior coding skills, or even math skills, just an interest for gaming and technology. Most of my cohort got a job in way less time, many even before the camp ended. I got to be a help teacher after my bootcamp and can give a few tips, as some of the difficulties students had were similar in the next group. - Read up and get as good as you can before the bootcamp. I was not particularly well prepared (I would say average to below average skill level), and had to work that much more. Don\'t do what I did. Don\'t procrastinate the pre-work. The workload is massive, and getting back on track when you start off-track is really, really hard. - Additionally, go out with the other participants! Get a beer (or ten)! Switch places in the classroom! Say yes to all the outings and beers and lunches and whatnot. Remember that when you\'re done there, your skill level is only one part of the picture. Your network and friendships are the stuff you actually remember. And practially speaking, I now have multiple contacts within the tech industry from all around the world. So make it a good experience by having fun, and not drowning in the work, and it\'s a win-win.- Take some distance. Take at least one day off per week. Don\'t use the weekend to get back on track (you will say this at some point).

Very little hours... Read More of sleep and usually thinking and dreaming about code.My story started with company lay-off, so I was unemployed looking for job and counting my money and looking for a way to make it last, a friend of mine recommended me IronHack, you could change carriers as I did , that sounded good ! and at least it could be an attractive boost to my current skills. I was having doubts but the day I payed the bootcamp a visit they talk me about some financing options, so I took some days to do my budget and gave it a green light, I enrolled in the next FT bootcamp. As I mentioned early, it was hard and challenging, if you have zero coding background (math is not that important) you better enroll in the part time bootcamp, if you had some coding subjects in school you just need to apply (a lot) yourself, if you know how to code but you want to learn fast and with help the bootcamp stack then it is a very good jump start for learning the language and the tools. Maybe you come from a different background that is not technology, if that is your case consider first the halftime bootcamp because it can get frustrating how little time you have and how many things you got to learn and how complex are the projects you have to deliver. My lead teachers were very good, very young (considering the average of my career teachers) but they were awesome coders and dedicated about teaching , sometimes a little cocky; my teacher assistants were good maybe sometimes hard to find or not as crafty as one would like, they were always well intentioned even the times the fix they gave you crashed your code, but every bootcamp has different teachers and assistants so only fortune can tell who your teachers are going to be. One thing I can tell you, yes the program will include the most fitted technologies to go and search for a job and enough knowledge to get you started as an entry level programmer, depending on how easy if for you to build upon those skills is who much more you can achieve in your job search, the other skills that you learned before also add up to that. In few words my bootcamp experience was very good,just remember, you need to be up to the task. About my job quest and job support experience, I can tell you that my job support has been very good, very unique times (covid pandemic) to be looking for job, I notice that the technology market keeps growing and keeps hiring people at least more than the other markets,some of them  are shrinking or paused, so I cannot tell at this moment if the same rules of the year before apply to my future job and salary offers, but I\'m glad the Tech and coding market is still hiring and growing. It is a great and outstanding work and support the one being made by the hiring support team I can tell that it makes a difference in your favor to have them, ( I notice because I pass many months looking for job by myself before the bootcamp), so it is awesome to have them once you finish the bootcamp, It is not a walk in the park, it is still demanding looking for a job but the burden is less. Is it worth it ? well, short answer YES, is not cheap ( try looking for a scholarship or financing help); the end is just the beginning, as you finish the bootcamp you notice that there are SO many different technologies, tools and languages out there that it gets a little overwhelming, so look into the things you like and apply yourself on learning those new things you want or need.I have many thing to tell but I think these word are good enough to give you an idea of the experience.

This decision turned out to be an amazing add on to my existing set of skills and made me a much better engineer.Experience summary:- High workload;- High complexity on the topics;- So many new and useful things learned!- Machine Learning module is awesome, but short.- Very competent teaching staff;- Super responsible and caring administrative staff;- Cool extra seminars along the bootcamp, for example: Build an ETL Pipeline, Build a Django App;- Beer and pizza offered by IronHack on events! :)Detailed experience:The program is very well distributed. The first weeks were mainly dedicated to learn basic programming and to clean data in Python. Since, data cleaning is such an important feature on a Data Scientist, the program has a very intensive approach on this subject (Very cool and useful!). We also spent a few days learning SQL, which is great, because it gives you a feel of the data warehousing task. Then, we learned how to manipulate data and make it \'readable\' for everyone, using super interesting data visualization libraries and software. At this point, we were only at the first part of the bootcamp. The workload was really high and the tasks were not easy, but I was learning so much! I thought it couldn\'t get more difficult, but then, second part of the bootcamp came on...After this point not only the workload increased, but the complexity of the subjects studied also increased! We started going deep on Statistics. This was a very challenging and important part of the bootcamp, since Statistics are one of the stepping stones of Data Analytics. The last weeks were dedicated to the coolest topic (in my opinion) - Machine Learning! We got to learn multiple algorithms and techniques to develop prediction projects. In the last project on campus (2 weeks project), we had to develop a Machine Learning Model and present our results. I was really happy and excited on the last weeks, cause I got to see and feel the potential of an amazing technology like Machine Learning. However, I got the feeling that we needed to dedicate more time on the Machine Learning module. The program should be reviewed in the sense that it should dedicate more time to study Deep Learning. The teaching staff was very competent! We had 4 teachers available - 1 lead teacher and 3 assistant teachers. They were really good educating and there was always someone available to help. Very effective teaching system!Besides the technical characteristics and the teaching staff of the program, I also feel that is important to refer that the administrative IronHack staff was really amazing with me. They not not only did a good job on a professional level, but also, on a personal level.

I will try to be as honest as possible. Before the course starts, students must complete prework assignments based off an online learning platform.... Read More The platform was a good start but didn’t always provide all necessary information or enough examples to completely understand the material. The TAs are available to help, but in my experience they didn’t always get back to me right away (I later learned why—the TAs are extremely overworked). The prework needs improving because there’s no good way to accurately see if you’ve learned enough before the course starts, even by completing the two assignments. As for the course itself: class was from 9-18:00 but if you’re taking it seriously, you’ll stay several extra hours to complete the lab assignments. It’s lots of self-learning. The website is accurate in its structure of the day, with lectures and labs interspersed. They’re good at giving you lots of breaks, which you’ll need. The TAs are amazing and work hard to help you, sometimes sitting down for long periods of time to debug your code. Personally I think they did more than the teacher and deserve more pay/credit. On the other hand, the fact that TAs can help you whenever and assignments are often done with partners, it’s hard to know if you truly understand the material. You might be completing assignments after receiving help from others, so it’s hard to gauge whether you’ve comprehended it all. Personally I felt like my TAs coded my entire project because I didn’t understand any of it, while the feedback from the TAs was very positive. I therefore felt there was a huge discrepancy because they couldn’t truly see how people were doing. When I tried to advocate for myself, they always just told me I was fine. The projects overall are a great way to break into a new career. You’ll learn a lot and add to your portfolio. Additionally, you’ll do 1/2 daily labs, mini projects, so you’ll build up a good foundation. After the bootcamp I think learning online would be impossible. IH barely scratches the surface, and to learn the same amount without a bootcamp would take years, especially without help from peers. On the other hand, I personally think IH isn’t the right bootcamp anymore. Perhaps it once was, but its career services leave something to be desired (in the case of my class: a career). Our hiring week took place right before Christmas, so it might as well not have happened, as no one hires then anyway. After that, we received only a couple emails within the three months after graduating, not nearly enough compared to the services promised. They also weren’t overly available for meetings so scheduling usually wasn’t instantaneous, and my meetings were short and seemingly unproductive. They told me things I already know. More frustrating is the fact that of all the people in my class looking for a new job, only a small number got hired within those three months, probably well below a 50% hiring rate, or even 30%. Overall, a bootcamp may or may not be a good decision, but for the financial and physical and mental health costs, IH is not the best choice.Read Less','ironhack'),(232,263469,'UX/UI Design','2020-04-11',0,5,5,5,5,'Best decision of my life.

Read More it\'s hard to find them about this specific course in Berlin, so this is why I decided to write my opinion here.Maybe I will start from positive part here. The working environment it\'s really amazing, mostly due to the people who participate in the course. It\'s really great to work with people with different skills and with various background - everyone was very supportive, kind and helpful. When you are stuck with anything, you can always count on your classmates. Also, I think the curriculum is well constructed and contains the most important information - of course, it\'s super intense and it\'s not possible to remember everything from the lectures but you will get a forever access to the learning platform - pretty helpful. The cool building, comfortable chairs and the free barista were also big advantages :)Before joining the course, I studied carefully the info and details on their websites. For sure, Ironhack promises a lot and it\'s not suprising, beacuse the bootcamps are very expensive (and getting even more). I would like to refer here to some of their promises.First of all the, the group was bigger than they promised, and way bigger than in the different locations. I was counting for a small group and pair work experience, instead it was more like back-to-school and 4 people in the group way of working - way too much.First of all, the lead teacher is not a UX/UI designer, but a visual designer, and actually he is not even really interested in the UX part and as he admitted, he has never really worked with it. I expected him to have a broad knowledge about UX, but it was pretty limited to the slides he was presenting. Also, he was very hardly accessible - he was usually leaving early or were always busy with something else. To be honest, he didn\'t seem really interested in the job.Ironhack presents itself as a team tech spec - but a lot of times they are just lacking skills. The teacher and TA are definitely not specialist in the softwares that are used during the course - it\'s very disappointing. During the career week, some invited people to the school seemed pretty random - maybe just to fill our time with something? I\'m not sure if inviting a person who is an ex-TA who doesn\'t have a job yet as an interview specialist or doing negotiation workshops with a person who has no experience with it is the best idea... I think Ironhack should really take closer look at the people who they are hiring - both the teacher and TAs seem often unmotivated and not really engaged in their work. I understand they are not professional designers but sometimes their advice and knowledge is lower that the participants of the course. And also, complaining about students in the common areas, where everyone can hear it, is VERY unprofessional.Overall, I learned a lot during the course, but it was a lot of my individual work I put in it and also from people I ask for advice from - unfortunately I can\'t say the staff was really helpful. I think that Ironhack is not a bad school, but for this price, people\'s expectations were way higher, what almost everyone admitted at the end. At the moment, I\'d advice to think twice before joining campus in Berlin and maybe to consider different locations.Read Less','ironhack'),(310,258520,'Reviewing the data analytics course.','2019-11-07',0,5,5,5,5,'The school made a lot of promises bout the course and amazingly delivered all of them.

You will have classes imparted by a teacher where you will have fun from start to finish, it might be rough, it might be tough but its always fun. I went by this curriculum and it actually help me understand coding and gave me great foundations on how to study and learn new technologies. I still go about learning new technologies the same way I did at Ironhack. If you follow this curriculum(understanding it, reading it before class and then solving every doubt you have during classes) and finish EVERY part of it(even the extras) you will leave Ironhack knowing enough to get hired anywhere.Instructors: My teacher was Nick Borbe, my TAs were Marcos Palacios and Manuel Cabrera. Everyone was great, super helpful and knowledgeable. If at any point they did not know the answer to something you asked they would look into it and comeback with the answer. Great people all around. Job Assistance: Ironhack is the best, and that\'s in no small part thanks to Daniel Brito, this guy will find you a job. He won\'t hold your hand during the process but if he sees you putting in 200% he will put in 300%. Make use of him, ask him questions, show him you are interested and he will help you. Overall: As with any other course or any type of education process you will get back what you put in. If this is really what you want I can\'t think of a better place to learn the basics of coding/programming/web develpment than at Ironhack. They helped me change my life for the better, I\'m finally happy with what I do and actually miss work when I\'m on vacation.

If you have past work experience that relates at all to the duties of a UX/UI designer or even if you just had a strong interest in parts of the process, this will come in handy! I’d always had an interest in art and had done some graphic design before. On the other hand, if you have zero relevant experience and were interested in completing this course, I would say to be patient and realistic about where your skills might be by graduation time.

Most of the other students had had at least a little bit of exposure to coding before the course, so they were able to keep up with the instructor. A few students (including me) had never had any exposure and we fell behind and could never catch up. I was repeatedly told that it was ok if I knew nothing about coding, but it felt like a little more understanding was necessary to understand the fast-talking teacher I had for coding week. Daniel Brito was my career coach while I was there and I really appreciated his support. He gave me a lot of awesome advice and helped me see things from the perspective of the employer. Although he was busy assisting lots of students, he did a good job of dividing up his time and giving me his full attention when it was my turn. In the end, I walked away with a portfolio that helped me get my current job, so it was worth it for me!

Read More Turns out, I already had a solid enough background that I likely needed a step up from what Ironhack had to offer. That said, I think the program is great for the right audience– people who are looking to change careers or don\'t have a background in design or creative problem solving at all whatsoever. The pros:- The curriculum is ever-changing with the times and the Ironhack staff did a good job making course corrections as our cohort went on.- It\'s a great base for anyone looking to learn UX/UI as a new skill/career path.- The class size is pretty small and the relationships forged are great for post-graduation.- We had a number of opportunities to network with past alumni and hear about what/how they\'re doing now.The cons:- Execution of the curriculum felt a bit disjointed and disorganized. We did too many super short projects to be able to really dig deep and learn any nuances.- The coding week was a disaster– it was entirely unplanned and we didn\'t get additional resources until three days into the week. At $1000+/week, 3 wasted days is not cheap.- This may not be a con to everyone, but the program and the Ironhack staff were a bit too chill for me. There were a lot of rules that they really drove home at the beginning... but never followed through on. The execution was lacking and we ended up being treated like both children and adults simultaneously.- We were promised things repeatedly that we never received. (For example, we were supposed to have professional headshots taken, but the photographer was a no-show and the staff chose not to reschedule for us. Our headshots were taken on an iPhone. Again– at $12k/person, we should be able to reschedule a photographer.) A lot of little things like that added up to a negative experience.For my situation personally, I made the best decision I could with the information I had.

Anything answers he didn\'t have, he knew how to find them! In general Nico was great person who was easy talk to and made you feel comfortable throughout the learning process.The curriculum itself is well thought-out and constantly changing. You really feel you are learning whatever technology is the most relevant.

Struggles that ultimately left us feeling unprepared for the real world...and robbed!Ironhack attracts plenty of motivated people who are a pleasure to be in class with. The sense of camaraderie is strong and It feels good to be in deep with the your fellow classmates. We all worked hard together, helped each other out and bonded over struggling with the same difficult sections.Thankfully Ironhack was good about making sure there are some unwinding opportunities. Lisa and Jess did an excellent job of keeping the energy up and organizing much needed stress relief moments that gave everyone an opportunity to unplug, eat some pizza and drink a little beer (or kombucha).Finally Brito is there to make sure we stayed focused on the reason most of us joined the course: To get jobs! Brito helped us prioritize what\'s important in terms of our future careers. He has tons of extremely useful experience in terms of what companies are looking for when hiring talent. He makes us looks good and gives us pro tips on building out resumes and our Linkedins. Brito also does an excellent job bringing in tech veterans to share their knowledge with us. We\'ve had speakers talk to us about the hiring process, the tech world, problems we may face, and even set up mock technical and soft skill interviews. If you have a specific interest in something in particular Brito will connect you with someone from his MASSIVE and beautifully organized list of tech contacts and Ironhack alum. Brito works very hard and is constantly finding new opportunities for graduates to pursue.Prior to Ironhack I was exhausting myself working as a cook and making next to nothing. As someone who is now happily working as a web developer, signing up for Ironhack was one of the smartest moves I\'ve ever made.

Read More engineer in another country to being a web developer in France in a matter of months!I already had some knowledge about the taught topics prior to the bootcamp - that helped a lot as the course is really intense - but I still needed to consolidate my skills, acquire new ones and focus full-time on coding.Not only did the bootcamp match those expectations, it also allowed me to land my dream job in little more than a month since graduation and it was a great investment for my future.The course structure is great and each module focuses on a key aspect: it helps keeping things that simple. Also the technical stack is modern and highly valuable in the job market; you learn JavaScript and then use it in the backend and in the frontend; I think it\'s a smart choice and you can have so much more practice using always the same language.If I had to highlight just one aspect of the bootcamp, it would be working on the 3 projects with other students: it really helped shaping us as developers and working with people with so diverse backgrounds - but with the same objective in life - was the greatest learning and working experience I\'ve ever had.Thanks to the topics covered during classes, which were always engaging and featuring what you really need to know, we were able to progress really quickly. The instructors and teaching assistants were extremely helpful and they always strove to make everything as smooth as possible for all the students.Pair programming and exercises were a daily task and they allowed us to discover many topics and real life workflows in software development.However a lot of effort is required to stay on track: only passion and commitment will drive you through the 9 weeks, so be sure about your objectives and dreams. If it checks for you, then you\'ll be a perfect match.Also the career services were a great asset to me: I have learnt all you need in order to find the right job. We met several professionals in the sector during the whole course and the hiring fair was a blast! We met 14 companies (and some of us were hired by these very companies) in 2 days and it was the best training I could have asked for all the following interviews.However I think that the course materials (written lessons and exercises) still need some improvement: as technologies evolve so quickly, it\'s hard to keep all the materials up to date. I don\'t think that this issue was a limiting factor for the bootcamp at all but I\'d like to be honest about it. Also a major revision of the contents is in progress, so I wouldn\'t worry too much about it. Moreover Ironhack keeps growing and evolving so it can only get better with time.On a final note, the location and the people you meet there are amazing and you\'ll definitely want to stick around every day.I hope this review can be useful to other people as I\'ve tried to cover some of the topics that concerned me before joining the course.

I did a lot of research, soul-searching, and self-teaching prior to the program. In general, I had a positive experience with the program, but it has its share of pros and cons, and would benefit... Read More some more than others.One of the best parts of the program is the classroom/workshop setting. It was challenging to make much progress learning on my own despite having several friends who are already experienced UX designers. The opportunity to connect with others who are also looking to break into the field, share ideas and learnings with them, and build a portfolio alongside them, was invaluable. The other is the job placement support. At the end of the program, students are able to attend a hiring fair, which is like speed-dating with companies for jobs. That in itself is an amazing opportunity for new designers. Additionally, the outcomes manager, Brito, is a fantastic resource. He is well-connected in the industry within South Florida and readily available to provide guidance with your job search. That said, if you aren\'t looking for a job in South Florida, then I\'m not so sure that Ironhack Miami would be the best program for you -- I would definitely recommend a program that is local to wherever you want to begin your career.I also really appreciated the instructor, David Fast. He is super knowledgeable and a great mentor. I always got tons of insight whenever I had a 1:1 with him. However, even in my class of only 11 students, this was a rare and often rushed occurrence. In one instance, I was scheduled to meet with David last, and then my meeting never happened. I wished the program were better structured to allow all students an equal opportunity to meet with their instructor regularly.We also had a high churnover of TAs, and some were more helpful than others.The curriculum could also be improved. It was very high-level and theoretical -- a lot of content that we could have easily read about on our own. Sometimes we just watched a YouTube video in class -- it boggles me that I am paying tuition, commuting to class, and spending class time to watch something I could have streamed at home. I\'d rather class time be spent on learning tricks of the trade, things that would boost our skills and portfolio, things that we could readily transfer to the workplace. Not things that I could easily Google or watch on YouTube.The program manager, Jessica, is super personable and resourceful. I appreciated her effort to provide opportunities for us to work with real companies for our final project. Although I was very excited by the idea, ultimately I passed on the opportunity because the options available were limited and did not align with my learning or portfolio goals. I know that some of my classmates had less than positive experiences working with these companies as well. I think this is one area where, if improved, could make or break my recommendation of the program to others.Finally, I don\'t think this program is for everyone. I think either the interview process or the pre-work or both could be a bit more rigorous to set the right expectations. As an example, if you were to ask the Web Dev students why they enrolled in their program, 99% of the time they would say it\'s because they love coding. But if you asked the UX students the same question, you rarely hear that it\'s because they love design or product. I think Ironhack could better screen prospective students and help them be sure that this is the right step for them.

I\'d had a little experience coding in HTML and CSS before I started the course, but had no programming experience and only a little knowledge of how the internet works. The bootcamp really kicked my butt!! It felt the entire time that I was not keeping up as much as I\'d have liked even though I was spending every waking hour learning as much as I could (i.e.: reviewing on the trains to and from the course, staying late to finish exercises, learning on the weekends...). I found that this was a pretty common feeling for a lot of people in the course, so you build great connections and help each other along the way. It was also essential that the teachers were so dedicated and supportive. It was my first introduction to how social coding could and should be.In the end, even though a lot of the content was over my head throughout the course, I found that I\'d learned enough to land the software developer job I\'d had my eyes on since before the bootcamp. I\'ll be working in various languages, so showing my newly-gained knowledge of Javascript was enough to prove that I will be able to learn and work in other programming languages as well. Advice for anyone starting the course (especially if you have no programming experience like me!): Do yourself a favour and spend as much time as possible with the pre-work! I wish I\'d spent more time with the Javascript part, it ended up being harder than I\'d expected to wrap my head around the basics and I kind of ran out of time before the course started. I\'d recommend even supplementing the pre-work with tutorials so that you really have a good grasp of the basics that are introduced there. There are lots of great tutorials online, free and paid, I learn really well with teamtreehouse.com for example.It\'s been said a lot already, but it\'s totally true: work hard, don\'t give up, trust the process, and stay curious.

However, future students, let me be clear that Brito is there to provide guidance, not hold your hand until you find a job.

I had an AMAZING experience with Ironhack Miami. To give you an idea of how the class is structured, Week 1 and 2: FRONTEND: learn JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery,... Read More DOM Manipulation, Canvas. Week 3: Use those skills to create a game application, present at end of the week. Week 4 and 5: BACKEND: learn Node.js and Express, amongst numerous other topics. Week 6: Use those skills to create a full-stack application, present at the end of the week. Week 7: Learn React.js. Week 8 and 9: Create a Full-Stack MERN application, present at the end of Week 9. All non-project weeks are pretty much structured the same: Topic 1 lecture in the morning, then a paired lab. Topic 2 lecture in the afternoon, then a solo lab. The class was structured to have one lead instructor and 2 TAs. While this might sound similar to other bootcamps you\'ve researched, I would like to point out the stand outs that make Ironhack Miami unique, which are the reasons why I ultimately chose it instead of other bootcamps I looked at:1. Career Services: I can pretty much guarantee you will not find another bootcamp with a Career Services Manager like Daniel Brito. Not only is he incredibly well connected and great at creating partnerships with the school and local companies, but he is SO resourceful and involved. He typically lectured once a week to the class for an hour, and once you graduate the meetings get more frequent and more specialized to each student and their current job situation. I\'ve been a working professional for 10 years and Brito still had great LinkedIn, Resume and Career advise to offer that I had never heard. While Brito is not the ONLY benefit to joining Ironhack, he is the most impactful benefit, hands down.2. Pre-Work: This was the second most beneficial part of Ironhack for me. Other bootcamps I looked at did not require pre-work, but this was by far the difference that made me not completely lost when I started school. While the pre-work was VERY hard for me, as I was a career changer and not used to the terminology, the technologies or anything, the pre-work was SO helpful because it . forced me to familiarize myself with all of this BEFORE class started. If there had no been . pre-work, I don\'t think I would have been nearly as successful in the class as I was.3. Building.co: this is the building Ironhack is located in. Some great features to note about it that were super helpful being a student- 24 hour access to the building, via secured access, unlimited free granola bars, unlimited free coffee (of ANY type), unlimited beer on draft starting at 5 PM, cool kitchen/outdoor space with picnic tables and corn hole to relax and take breaks. Building.co is a co-working space so there are a lot of tech people who have desks there to work, which is ideal for networking as a tech student. 4. Guest speakers: tech speakers were brought in typically once every 2 weeks to talk to the class. This was helpful for networking purposes, but also for insight into the industry, what people do, what they are looking for, etc.5. Lisa - the Growth Manger, was always great about hosting industry events at Building.co and in the area for students to attend with Miami tech industry people. This, again, was great for networking and more exposure to the industry.6. The curriculum was well thought out and offers a lot of resources for you to have outside of class. If you pay attention in class, then go back and read all of the lectures, you will get the most benefits. Now that I am out of school and interviewing, I realize how many of the interview questions/vocab were in our lesson plans, I just never read them during class. READ THE LECTURES!!!

It\'s a full time 9-5pm every day for 9 weeks (not including the after hours you want to put in as well) it\'s no joke so just prepare to fully invest the next 9 weeks into IronHack. You learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week - repeat again 2 more times after that. Come in prepared to learn, take in all the material, and be willing to put in the work.Help During Course Work / Curriculum (TA’s and Teacher)The instructor for our Cohort (Nick) was very knowledgeable. The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course, so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too. Besides that, he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject, I would not have learned as much as I did. As for the teaching assistants, all three of them were amazing (Sandra, Marcos, Ian). They were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all Ironhack graduates as well. It was extremely helpful having dedicated TA\'s who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help. There\'s more than enough help to go around, just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you won\'t fall behind.The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days, our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out. During the course this was one of my top issues, the curriculum for sure needed an update, but from what I have seen after my time there they are (or already have) taken the steps necessary to do so. Which means they take your feedback seriously and won\'t brush your input aside.Rest of Ironhack StaffSince the first day I applied and even now the staff at Ironhack hasn’t missed a beat. They have been helpful and there for me with any questions I had. They have an idea as to what they want to do with the course, and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible. It doesn’t matter who you try to contact, the owner, down to the TA’s, they all respond happily and make you feel like one of them.Hiring Fair PrepFrom the first week at Ironhack, you become well acquainted with a man named Brito. Take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job. He walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you, such as building your resume, creating your LinkedIn, and lets you know about networking events to attend. He constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly. Brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him. Along with all this prep work, you are also creating your portfolio during the course. You create 3 projects (on your own or in a small group) which showcase everything you\'ve learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio.Hiring Fair EventAt the end of the course, Brito arranges companies to come to Ironhack and sit down with you for interviews. This is a valuable introduction for your first interviews. Eventually, you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn\'t do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them. Still, that doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously, definitely come prepared to nail them during the event - people DO get hired out of these. This is what you prepare for, and it helps to prepare for future interviews.Post Ironhack ExperienceAfter Ironhack, finding a job (if that is what you are there for) is the next battle. Brito is there with you every step of the way. He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps, the job hunt instantly becomes much harder. Take your LinkedIn, networking, and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort, and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank/Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300+ jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in-person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding, I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp, but do not quit.ConclusionYes - you learn a lot at Ironhack and are given great guidance, but no they will not hand you a job. You get everything you need from them and now it’s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100% do it again, I put my life on hold, invested in myself, pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn’t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack, but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.If you have any questions feel free to message me on LinkedIn and I will gladly answer them for youRead Less','ironhack'),(548,244262,'Amazing learning experience!','2018-09-23',0,5,5,5,5,'I recently completed the part-time Web Development course, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their skills or technological knowledge base.

Read More going into it, because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up. My class had 3 exceptional TA\'s, Manuel, Colby, and Adrian, who constantly were able to provide assistance when I ran into trouble, had bugs, or just got lost. They were always nice, patient, and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure I really understood deeply what we were learning, including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail. I was really impressed with -and grateful for- each of them. I was also very impressed with the professor, Alan. He is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching. Always patient, courteous, and welcoming of questions, feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems. What really impressed me most about Alan, is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges, to prepare us to think like computer scientists, and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview, and explain the different ways to approach the problems, and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management. It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course, and I found these lessons particularly rewarding. Alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution. *Protip* Always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents, I noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding. If he gives you the marker, get up there and give it your best effort. Go home and research the concepts further. JUST DO IT! Get a whiteboard, for your house, and write important concepts, objectives, goals, and problem examples from class. This will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis. You will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews, and they\'re abstract, and frustrating if you are not prepared.After graduation, you\'ll be counseled by Brito, your career counselor, who is also a very cool, down-to-earth and knowledgeable person. He has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process, how to construct your resume, and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers. I am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive, helpful, and make sure you land a good starting job, well after graduation. Looking back I am extremely thankful to Ironhack and humbled to have had the opportunity to study with such an awesome class. Everyone from my classmates to the teachers, to the teacher\'s assistants, to the career counselor have all been an absolute pleasure to deal with. Also, I was blown away by the Ux/UI students.

Read More pieces or enclaves in a society. In my particular case, immigrant and with more than 17 years previous working in the commercial area in Sales of Technology, having made the decision to invest in the training of Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp in Ironhack has meant a turning point in my career. And for me it has been precisely that: an investment in the future.When I decided that I wanted to return to the roots of my studies (I\'m an Computer Engineer) after so many years without writing a line of code, concerned only about selling products that in some cases I did not understand what they do, I started a search for a study system that I could obtain the necessary knowledge to go in search of a job in what many years ago was my livelihood and why not, my satisfaction. For this I enrolled in some basic PHP / Javascript courses with MySQL Database and an additional Oracle Database 12c course. But they were just that: basic courses. They gave me an aerial view of what Web development is in these times but they did not go deep enough to feel safe to go after a job in the development area.And as in social networks there is nothing hidden (we know how the algorithms that make product suggestions work, learning our tastes and posting notices of topics that we have touched or visited previously) I saw in one of these networks, an advertising of a Full Stack Web training that caught my attention because of its content. It was not a simple computer course like other ones in the market. It was really a formal study where in two and a half months a good part of the tools, frameworks, methodologies, etc., would be covered for the development of Web applications. It described how we are going to go, from the basics to making applications that from a user\'s point of view were as complex as making calls to API\'s RestFUL of spatial geolocation to create technology trending Web applications. A walk through HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, NodeJS, Express, Ajax, Axios, Angular all this with MongoDB Database, alternating with continuous development tools such as GIT and project planning as Trello. I found it a challenge and as I said initially, an investment for my return to the area that brought me so much satisfaction. Of course, I did an exhaustive search of trainings of this type in Madrid to make a comparative table and I finally decided on Ironhack because it seemed to me the most complete of all the training I saw, in addition to the fact that I am very learning in person, to be near the instructor and surrounded by people who could ask for help to clarify doubts if that were the case. For this reason, I proceeded to write via email to the contact person that appeared in the promotion. The answer was immediate and I started the procedures to be able to register for the FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOT CAMP - FULL TIME JUNE 2018 training. Here the journey began.Important to clarify that I did not have the money to do this training but here is another advantage that immediately allowed me to strengthen my decision. At Ironhack, they have two financial support institutions that could finance the training with the necessary flexibility to cover the costs. What more could I ask for!Now, I went through a series of questions and qualification interviews to validate if I had the capacity to do this training and that they did not represent a problem for me to enter since I had the advantage of having studied Computer Engineering 25 years ago and something was left of the programmatic thinking. I went immediately to the Pre-Work, a series of exercises and activities to soak students with certain basic knowledge and thus start from the first day to learn everything necessary to carry these two and a half months of intensive training. And that\'s what it is, that\'s why the denomination of Boot Camp. Let\'s understand the concept. Here you come to work. And work hard. Every day, from Monday to Friday and including several weekends, is hard work. Beginning with the fact that two exercises (or projects) are done daily. One in the form of pair-programming, which gives us the notion of what it is to work with a team, and the other project you work individually. And some of these exercises tend to be extensive which makes it difficult to finish without staying up late (my personal recommendation for those who register: do not get up late, seek to do what possible but put a limit on working hours because fatigue accumulates day after day and every day you will see important matter that requires attention and all the senses in it). And every two weeks there will be a large project (three in total) where you can practice what you have learned in the previous weeks. For this reason, if you feel that some of the concepts were not well learned, calm that in each project will have the opportunity to resume and apply these concepts.It is true that many concepts are seen, but the learning methodology, being able to use continuous development tools such as GIT, working as a team in various exercises or projects, is basically what you face in real work environments. And for that they prepare you.Another important point to note is the support and ongoing advice on human resources issues, where you will have sessions to improve your Linkedin profile (or create it for those who have not registered) and your résumé. As an anecdote, just changing some things in my profile, I got the first day two contacts of people looking for Web developers from England. These consultancies are worth their weight in gold and should be used as much as they are part of the Ironhack program that seeks to position their students in the labour market. And believe me, its work.Finally, after two months and a week of continuous learning, Ironhack organizes a week called the hiring week where they invite a group of companies that will be validating your projects and interviewing students for possible work places to be filled with Boot Camp students. It is time to show your talents and you have a high chance of getting a job related to the topics seen. Particularly I had already gotten a job before this week so I did not attend and yet you have saved the opportunity to attend some future process if you wish.Finally, it must be understood that Ironhack, besides being a learning academy, is also a community. A community where events are constantly being published where you can review trends, new technologies or simply have an invitation to spend a Friday evening with friends with some beers. As a member of this community you can call to give a talk to new students about your experience, how to handle the stress of the activities, or simply accompany a new student under the figure of buddy in order to listen and advise how to carry The Boot Camp to these new members.Ironhack has been an experience, an investment that has paid off and allowed me to reinsert myself into the technical world, something that fills me with satisfaction. It was a total good experience in which a made a good friends and contacts in a web partners that for sure, is going to be maintained for years.Jesús Martínezwww.linkedin.com/in/jesus-martinez-alvarezRead Less','ironhack'),(558,245046,'The Last of Our Stack: MEAN Web Dev','2018-09-17',0,4,4,4,4,'I\'ve recently finished the MEAN stack 9-week bootcamp in Madrid with no previous coding experience and, let me say, what a blast!

I chose to wait until after I had been out of the course and in a job for a while before reflecting on my experience... Read More and evaluating how well Ironhack prepared me for what I am currently doing. My Ironhack Experience: Application: I did a great deal of research within a small period of time before applying, going through the interview process and leaving my previous employer to join Ironhack. Like many other students, I decided on Ironhack because of the curriculum, the reputation of Brito as an Outcomes Manager, and the reputation of their lead instructor Nizar, however, when the cohort started I learned that we would have a new instructor, Nick, an Ironhack graduate. When I registered for this course many of my classmates and I was under the impression that Nizar would be our teacher who I understood was someone with years of real world experience and was the primary reason for all the great reviews about Ironhack.I decided about three weeks before the cohort started to join in April which was just enough time before it was too late. The coding challenges and pre-work used the same online portal which contained their learning modules. Once I got the learning material I had to get them done within the one week I had before the cohort started so I worked that week on the online material full time to get ready for the first week. I cannot stress how important it is for you to really focus on the pre-work and understand the meaning behind what it is that you are going to be learning and do further research when necessary. If at any point you find yourself questioning whether or not this is for you, take time away from the problems you are having and come back to it with a fresh perspective. This is a habit you should try to incorporate in your learning as you are working with abstract concepts you haven’t been exposed to yet or are re-learning. It\'s really easy to get frustrated when you are first starting out which causes some students to drop out of the cohort before it really has time to start. Curriculum / Lectures / Projects: The first week is spent developing a browser game which when I initially signed up sounded like a lot of fun, and at times it was, however, I do not feel that it fits the curriculum when considering how much better the time could be spent. I would recommend spending more time to focus on the fundamentals, working collaboratively (git-flow), and more time on coding challenges/interview prep. Many of the examples within the modules when learning these new concepts were essentially the same which made it harder to grasp some of the concepts we were going over. A large portion of information, direction, and dependencies for the labs and lectures were out of date or not set up properly. Some learning modules were skipped altogether and a lot of time was wasted on bugs that can be avoided if the lecture notes and labs were updated or reviewed by the instructor before the lecture for the day began. I was also having a hard time grasping these concepts when I was encouraged to just copy paste what was in the modules to do my labs and my projects instead of thinking it though. There was a sudden change the day before the final project weeks started where our cohort was preparing to put together their individual projects for our personal portfolios and then it was announced that we would be working in groups for the last project. We were not told from the beginning that we were to take into consideration that we would be working on the final project in pairs or groups of three. We were never taught best practices dealing with version control and how to go about working with multiple people on a project at the same time. The brief overview that we had on collaborative git practices lasted less than 30 minutes and didn\'t even cover how to deal with merge conflicts or common errors that would come up in collaborative scenarios. Our instructor Nick was gone during the second to last week which was one of the most important weeks of our cohort. The majority of people in the course have been stuck on the same issue which dealt with having a login session persist across views in Angular. The only example we have to go off of was incomplete because of all of the bugs we ran into the week before Nick left and the TA’s were not able to figure out how to resolve the issue. If the Ironhack staff knew that he was going to be out during this important week that should have arranged for a substitute or have prepared the TAs to take over the curriculum for the week. The TAs would only be able to help to a certain extent until they are unsure of how to proceed due to their lack of experience and we\'re left to wait in line to be assisted by Nick, however that week we did not have the option so there was a great deal of lost time. My group members and I should not have been feeling the need to pay by the minute on tutoring websites like Hackhands and to make up for the lack of education we had received to get our project done in time. Learning Environment: I can’t speak for other cohorts, but the April 2018 cohort was fantastic. Everyone got along really well and we all still keep in touch with one another regularly post-graduation. Building.co is a fantastic workspace. Free beer, coffee, fruit, snacks, and there are plenty of good options for eating in the area. My only criticism is that Building.co can get a bit cramped at times as far as private areas for studying and meetings go, but that’s expected considering it’s a co-working space. The TAs were incredibly helpful throughout the cohort. Shoutout to Sandra for always staying far later than she needed to help us with our projects throughout the cohort. I’m sure I speak for all of my classmates when I say that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve what we did without the support of the TAs. Brito also brought in some great guest speakers and organized a panel of alumni to come to talk to us about their post-graduate experiences. Career Week: Career Week is the most important week you will at Ironhack. The content during this week is crucial to your job search and should be followed to the letter if you plan on getting hired and will be applicable beyond entry-level job searches. If you haven’t heard of or really considered Career Week as a selling point for your investment in an experience at Ironhack I would highly encourage you to reconsider and look at some of the companies that Ironhack is partnered with and the companies that graduates like myself are currently working at.Career week is a fantastic opportunity where companies come to Ironhack in order to interview graduates in a speed dating” fashion. You get to meet with many companies, and if you are inexperienced with interviewing like I was at the time, it may help you to get over the nervousness of being in an interview. If you\'ve read any of the other reviews on this site or other sites about Ironhack Miami I\'m sure that you have read or heard the name Daniel Brito or Brito for short. Brito is the Outcomes Manager, and it is his responsibility to work towards partnerships with companies and bring them in to meet potential graduates as candidates for entry-level jobs. He’s one of the most connected people in the Miami tech scene and has your best interests in mind. Ironhack would not be the same without his efforts. He was one of the most supportive people throughout the entire cohort and has continued to help me after graduation and reach out to me to see how my new job is going.  Post-Graduation / Job Search: I received my job offer from CareCloud, one of the companies that came to our hiring fair, about a month and a half after the cohort ended. However, do not place all your bets on getting a job from one of the companies that come to career week, this would be a huge mistake. Brito will be there every step of your job search from interview to offer letter as long as you follow the guidelines and strategies that he goes into detail about throughout the week. Never stop coding during your search, it’s important to keep your committing to new projects and continuing your learning so that you have something to show employers what you’ve been doing with your time since graduation. If you lose your motivation to teach yourself after the cohort is over you’re going to have a very hard time finding a good job. Overall, I would recommend Ironhack to someone looking to make a career change, however, I would also like to see many things improved as it continues to grow. I felt that my cohort was disorganized and that there was a serious lack of curriculum preparation. I did not see efforts made to improve the quality of our experience throughout the cohort\'s duration although we were giving them feedback every few weeks. I was not satisfied with how my education at Ironhack turned out at the time of graduation. I went through career week and then graduated lacking the confidence in my skill set necessary to get through a real technical interview. The weeks following graduation I spent all my time working on projects and learning React which I knew would help me stand out more when looking for a job while reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals and applying to jobs using Brito\'s advice. I am currently writing up an accompanying article for this review that I hope will fill in any other gaps for those who are looking into or graduating from Ironhack and boot camps like it which will include helpful resources that I used before, during and after my boot camp experience that helped me get my new job at CareCloud.

My experience with Ironhack was absolutely fantastic and I would do it again, anytime. I will answer the questions I had when picking a bootcamp and hope this can help any future student. Why not do an online course ? What I found very special with Ironhack was how teachers and peers were an amazing motivation, something you don\'t get online. The teachers were available every day until 10 pm and even on weekends, which I found incredible, every time with a smile on their face. The teaching team also spend significant time on team building and allowing the students to get to know each other with after school events, cooking sessions, giving the whole experience a very personal touch. They were extremely helpful with every question I ever had, no matter how basic. Studying with a cohort of students and sharing a physical classroom made it much easier for me to keep it up even during hard days where the learning felt like a lot of work. Whats the niveau of the course and how much time do I need to spend during the course? I personally had some previous coding experience (Python and C++, but six years before the time of the course) and no idea about front end. There is elaborate pre-work distributed by Ironhack before the start of the physical course that allows you to prepare yourself if you feel insecure about being ready. I did not spend a lot of time on it and found that we were caught up onto the same level within the first days of the bootcamp. The course is intense and requires you to spend some long evenings in class, however, it is clear that everyone learns for themselves and teachers are supportive no matter what effort you make - if you keep it low for two days, you will not punished with a frown or less attention. Teachers continuously checked up on the students level of understanding and offered additional courses and catch-up sessions whenever needed. In general it does feel like the whole group goes from 0 to 100 in the two month, coding-wise. Does it make you job ready ?Totally. I personally was not looking for employment after the bootcamp as I was starting a Master\'s degree, but nevertheless talked to many CTOs, companies etc in the course of the bootcamp and realized how good you get at Ironhack.

Don\'t you dare go ghost on Brito during your job hunt. He\'s your wing-man, your therapist, your cheerleader on the sidelines and more -as long as you Slack him first. It took me three months after graduating (and A LOT of rejection) to land the job I\'ll be starting in a few weeks. Don\'t be afraid to hear no. Keep trying, and, if you\'re trying to land a web dev role, KEEP CODING. And even if you\'re not, KEEP LEARNING. Don\'t be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to jobs - there are other roles willing to pay you for the skills you acquired - my current role doesn\'t require coding, but the skill helped me land it. Brito was there throughout the entire process, constantly keeping track of my progress, and rooting for me the entire time. I\'m grateful to have gone through this experience because it really did change my life.

He is truly an excellent teacher; enthusiastic and very clear in his manner of explaining (simple and complex) concepts. I could not have asked for a better instructor for the course.The career services were also super helpful. The Outcomes Manager, Dina, helped us with our resumes, rebranding, and explaining our background to recruiters. We got to meet with many companies, as well as recruitment sites.

It was a very difficult and extremely challenging process for me, but the amount of knowledge and hands-on experience you acquire in only... Read More 2 months is amazing. Needless to say, the bootcamp experience is really not for the weak hearted. It pushes you beyond your limits and tests you on every level to really pull out the best within each student.The most important skill I’ve learned during my time at Ironhack was to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. That’s essentially the nature of the course; it forces each student to enhance their strengths, but most importantly, work on their weaknesses. There is limited time to get assignments done, so exercising better time management is essential. There are presentations and public speaking almost every week, there is the constant exercise of accepting failure and making mistakes, and the idea that perfection is your enemy (so if there are any perfectionists out there, get ready to let go of this habit guys, because everything is actually supposed to be “Agile”). I also learned that throughout any UX/UI design process, the user should always be the guide, and you really have to follow and respect the process, never jump to solutions. The staff at Ironhack was very helpful and most importantly, were always positive. It really helps to be surrounded by instructors and TA’s who believe in each student’s potential, who are ready to listen when you need to vent, who provide constructive feedback, any help needed or just be uplifting with optimistic comments. I am very grateful to everyone at Ironhack who guided me throughout the cohort: my teacher, David, my TA’s Hugo and Hector, my Web Dev week instructors Sandra and Colby, as well as Brito, our super dedicated Career Resources professional! They just made my time in the cohort extremely enjoyable and meaningful.Also, being in such an amazing co-working environment such as Building, helped make the experience memorable. I really love it there, I always feel welcome and comfortable, like it is my home away from home. I have spent A LOT of time there, and I love the fact that students have access to the space 24/7 with the use of the fob (I didn’t want to return mine at the end of the cohort!). It is no wonder I would always tell people who asked me about the course that I would live at Building and sleep in Aventura. I cannot express enough how much I loooooved being in that space and am happy to return each time I visit. Everything about it was awesome: the classroom environment with the ability to write and ideate on the white walls, cover the glass walls with our sticky notes, the nook with the comfy couch on the 2nd floor, cafecito at 3:05 brought to us everyday by the very sweet ladies: Mercedes and Maria, and especially the rooftop with the beer on tap. It is just a great space to get inspired, work, and also to network.The only cons I have for the cohort, is that I wish the course were longer. I personally think 3 months would be ideal, but if not, then at least 2 weeks extra so that the students can have more time to work with the web devs and also to better prepare for the hiring week. I felt an enormous amount of pressure to get my portfolio ready and honestly didn’t feel comfortable with what I presented to perspective employers. So it is important to have either an extra week to solely focus on that or to incorporate it more throughout the cohort (weekly check-ins on the progress, time for business cards to be made). It was constantly drilled into us that “the portfolio is what will get you hired”, so quality time to work on it is essential. Students will be better prepared and most likely result in more hires right out of the hiring fair. So, win win on both ends: great for the students as well as the school. Being able to work more closely with the web dev cohort is also essential in order to better prepare for the field. It would be great to work with them in fully developing one of our projects into a functional app, for example.Overall, my experience at Ironhack was very positive and this was the best investment I have done for my career. I had to overcome a lot of personal difficulties and blockers along the road, but truthfully, there is nothing more fulfilling than when you overcome something that initially might seem impossible, whether that is fear of public speaking or just delivering assignments on time. I loved every minute of the cohort and will forever be a proud Ironhacker.

Ironhack has a great network here in South Florida and companies absolutely notice their name on a resume or LinkedIn profile.Continue reading for a more detailed look at my journey at Ironhack.Background: I never worked in anything tech or programming related. I had some programming experience from undergrad and from there on out, I have been taking steps to improve my development skills but felt like I hit a wall.Why I joined: I wanted to build a portfolio and break down that wall. I wanted to switch careers and become a developer/engineer. I chose Ironhack over their competition because of the MEAN Stack, these reviews, and the passion and family-like culture I received upon initial contact with the staff.Staff: Ironhack keeps expanding and stays progressive with their vision and every employee really cares and believes in that vision. From the top down, everyone is approachable and makes you feel at home. Your instructor? IronhackerTA\'s? IronhackersThey have been in our shoes. They know what it takes to push you and make sure they set you up for success. They are happy to do it. It is not a job for them, it\'s a passion. My cohort had a new instructor, Nick. Everything I had read about Ironhack before joining was about Nizar and I had high expectations. Nick did a great job, and he had a great team of TA\'s too. Lead TA - Sandra is a machine. You will not fall behind even with the fast pace because of this.Experience: HIRED 6 weeks after hiring fairTo get the most out of this course, you will live, eat, breathe, and dream code. This is 9 weeks full time, and 1 more for hiring week. In these 10 weeks, do not expect to have a life outside of Ironhack. Make sure you have the full support of a significant other because it is not an easy balance. Your friends will be non-existent. It\'s a boot camp for a reason. Even with some coding experience, I would find myself still at Ironhack until 10-11pm most days. Project week will hit you like a ton of bricks. Beer on tap will keep you sane.On the bright side, you are going to be in a setting with dozens of people who have the same mindset and goals as you. This makes it a lot easier.What isn\'t obvious is that it does not stop after these 10 weeks. When you are looking for work afterward, it is also a full-time job. Expect to be looking for work for 4-8 weeks minimum.And it doesn\'t stop there. If you get hired, it\'s going to feel like another boot camp. So make sure you take that all into account before jumping in and make sure you can be fully committed. Job assistance: There is a hiring fair set up by Brito that at the very least will give you some practice on interviewing. I interviewed with 6 companies and with two of those, I went through their whole interview process afterward. I did not get hired by a company from the hiring fair (but others did).Brito makes sure you are taking necessary action in your job hunt and guides you. I applied aggressively and was able to land multiple phone interviews and several in-person interviews. Rejected by plenty, but in the end, I was able to get multiple offers.Conclusion: I would do it all over again if I could. I knocked down that wall and changed careers, and made great friends at the same time. Tips: Take your LinkedIn and resume seriously. Attend tech events and meetups. Try to do coding challenges on HackerRank and/or CodeWars.Feel free to message me on LinkedIn if there is anything else you\'d like to know.Read Less','ironhack'),(598,242553,'A great 9-week experience','2018-08-13',0,5,5,5,5,'I wasn\'t expecting much when I signed up for the bootcamp but at the end of it all I can say I\'m amazed in what I learned in such a short period.

Some other bootcamps teach about relational databases (SQL) and use outdated programming languages. I wanted the new stuff. There we learned the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS), which is what you need for getting your ideas out of the paper and put it into practice.I can say that I am currently fully capable of developing some ideas that never got out of paper because I didn’t even know where to start. I’ve tried to learn by myself, with free online courses, with paid online courses (actually one from Codecademy), but nothing compares to being more than 12 hours a day coding non-stop, doing pair programming, being in a class with other 20 people with the most different backgrounds and experience levels.At the end of the course we go through a Hiring Week, where we had like 40 interviews with companies wanting to hire people for IT jobs.

After three months of intense studying during the bootcamp, I must say that I managed to build a web app and I had the guts to apply for a front end position. After some trial and error, I finally got the job I wanted :)The pros of the bootcamp are that it\'s really accessible, that there were people there to support us even at 9 - 10pm, that the final project we worked for was really practical and mentored by people working in the field and that at the end we had great opportunities for interviews.I really liked that the levels of people in the cohort really varied so while some fellow students could help me with certain issues, I could, in my own turn, help other with different issues. This way, you never feel too bad about yourself. We also worked really hard, till late in the night sometimes, and the tutors were there to help. They were really nice, supportive and dedicated. For the final project, based the profile of the project, we got matched with someone working in the field. At the end, looking at what I had built, I felt proud and confident that I could take that app further. The tutors also helped us optimise our linked in profiles, we had professional photos taken and really felt that they did everything to help us find a job that we like.For me, the biggest benefit was that I figured out what I liked from web development (specifically Front End development) and that I gained confidence to apply for the job I wanted.The cons are that, indeed, being very accessible, you get people with very different backgrounds and for some it can be very difficult. I had some knowledge of how the web works, of HTML and CSS, but for who doesn\'t have any knowledge, I think it can be pretty frustrating to dive straight into web development with all its aspects. Also, Back End and Front End are a lot to cover in 3 months, so I would actually prefer it if they were separate. Then you\'d have more time to practice everything properly. Sometimes it felt rushed, because we had a curriculum to go through. That\'s about it. All in all, it\'s really helpful if you wanna taste the web development world and you\'re not sure which way to go. It also helps to fill in the gaps, if you have some knowledge already, but in bits and pieces, like I did.

Read MoreWhat were my expectations?1.- To learn the web programming language properly, both in the front, in which I already had some experience (not so much, as I discovered during the first days of the course) and in the back, where I was a complete newbie.2.- To find a good job to be proud of as a web developer, with opportunities for continuous learning and professional development that would allow me to obtain my desired stability to start building a good vital project.So...how was it?Incredible! A week after finishing the course, after metting almost 40 IT companies, all of them convened by Ironhack and most of them of hight standing, with numerous and attractive professional offers, I was signing with one of those companies that I was attracted the most, furthermore, it exceeded my expectations of learning, self development and gave me the possibility of working with cutting-edge technologies. In the end the extended knowledge I got during the Bootcamp allowed me to create three large projects to present to these companies that led them to get a better idea of ​​my new abilities and recently acquired capacities.What would you highlight?1.- The training, magnificent, very tuned to what companies require and very refined after the experience of many previous bootcamps\' feedbacks.2.- The teachers, full of knowledge and close to us, they would always be available, either in person or through the chat that we used.3.- The facilities, forefront and opened 7 days a week in which we passed around 12-14 hours at least 6 of them (7/7 the week of the final project). Comfy, well provided kitchen, WiFi and resting areas.4.- The great level of camaraderie and union shared among the students.

There will be many frustrating moments when you face difficulties and hight demanding code problems. Many of the daily exercises you can not do whole. The teachers are there to help but they will not take you by the hand.

In the morning you would study and follow along with a lesson for about three hours. Then you would make an excercise applying these lessons with a partner.

One great thing about Ironhack (Miami) is that people come with a diverse background. Entrepreneurs, lawyers, former construction workers and some who weren\'t tech savvy. It affirmed to me that these skills can be learned no matter your background.I especially appreciated their instructor’s hands-on learning approach. Like most bootcamps, Ironhack emphasizes a learn by doing approach.

You should come in prepared to work hard. Collaboration is crucial and spending time in Building Co. in Miami will be a part of the experience. Ironhack is fast paced. It doesn’t give you as much time to sit and think about ideas. Often it is more about taking action and figuring it out as you go. Failing fast is something you will have to get used to.

But it has everything you should need to succeed in the class. Again, the material is really good, but you have to go over it. They can only cover so much in class (and it will be a lot) but the course is structured in such a way that, to really get the most out of the course, you should be going over most if not all of the lessons.

Sadly quite a few of them had typos that made the instructions confusing. We did meet the person who is working on fixing them though. A previous Ironhack graduate who is passionate about getting those issues hashed out. So one of the few dings that I would give the class will probably not be relevant to whomever reads this. And for us it was not all that bad, since the instrutor and TAs were aware of the issues and were able to direct us in the right direction.Other than the labs, there are 3 big projects, one at the end of every module. Which is one of the best parts of the course in my opinion. It forces students to create things that they can show as experience and were where I learned the most in the course. Simple examples are great, but putting a complete project together really helps everything sink in.

For me, this was the hardest part, because raw Javascript may have a logic that could be hard to understand at the beginning.

At the end of this part 1, you have to develop a game; which is a very cool way to practice and learn as you code.The second part is the back-end part, learning NodeJs and Express. You just have to learn the logic and copy/paste what is in the Ironhack course and in the documentation to make everything work. You will learn how to manage a database and use APis (Google Maps\' API, Spotifiy\' API, etc).The last part, my favorite one, is to merge front-end and back-end, using NodeJs and REACT, which is a very cool language.

I can\'t recommend it enough, it\'s certainly not easy, and you have to put in a lot of work, but in the end it\'s worth it.Read Less','ironhack'),(677,240027,'One of My Best Life Decisions','2018-04-10',0,4.7,5,4,5,'I think when evaluating such a massive life and financial decision as a coding bootcamp, the most important aspect of the review is how likely the camp is to get you a job. I can say this: I came into Ironhack with an incomplete computer science degree... Read More and no meaningful work experience, and left with three scheduled job interviews, and I had a competitive entry-level developer job offer within two weeks of graduating. I don\'t think my experience is typical, but I do feel safe in assuming that if you come here prepared and work hard while you\'re here, you can leverage the experience into a new career.Before signing up, though, it\'s worth mentioning that the curriculum and instruction is in a period of transition. The previous instructor, Nizar, moved from Miami to Paris, and was replaced with Louis. Louis lacked Nizar\'s experience, and became less professional as the cohort went on, being less prepared for more advanced material and often leaving mid-day, letting the TAs (Jess and Sandra, who were both fantastic) manage the class. Louis isn\'t coming back - he decided to go to Japan after finishing the cohort - and I\'m not sure who his replacement is. If you\'re interested in the camp, that\'s the first thing I\'d ask about.The curriculum is largely solid, but has a few intermittent bugs and grammar issues. Honestly, though, I\'d rank it above my college experience in terms of usefulness and structure, as well as any class I\'ve seen on places like Udemy. It\'s intelligently structured, and gives you the information required to learn the skills necessary to complete exercises and build projects. They\'re also actively working on fixing issues in the curriculum right now, and it\'s a safe assumption that you will have a cleaner experience with the material than I did.I think the quality of the job assistance matters more than the quality of instruction in a bootcamp - realistically you could teach yourself everything here with a few Udemy courses, a solid work ethic, and maybe some contacts in the coding community or online - but it\'s hard to leverage that into a job. Job assistance is where Ironhack shines. Their job placements manager, Daniel Brito, is constantly working phones and email to get respected developers in the community to give presentations and companies looking for talent to come to hiring fairs. He has tons of resources to teach you how to manage your job hunt, and is pretty much constantly available for questions on Slack (or in emergencies, his phone). This effort is reflected in the experience - if you do as he says, you\'ll develop contacts in the Miami tech community, which will lead to job offers. It\'s also worth noting the location is incredible. The building is right next to a train stop in downtown Miami as well as a decent parking garage, and is blocks away from dozens of fantastic restaurants. The building itself is also amazing - it\'s a well-appointed coworking place with free snacks, coffee, and beer on tap. It was scary signing up for Ironhack, but I honestly think it was the smartest decisions I\'ve ever made in my entire life. I learned an employable skill in less than three months, got to make dozens of friends with other like-minded and driven people, and leveraged the experience into a new job. Expect to work hard - the 400 hour estimate they give you is low, and the most successful students were those that showed up a few hours early and left a few hours later - but if you do, it\'ll change your life.One more thing - if you decide to sign up for Ironhack, take a cohort date a few months from now, and spend some time learning the material. Colt Steele\'s Web Development bootcamp and Advanced Web Development bootcamps on Udemy are a fantastic primer for the large majority of the class, and completing at least the first course beforehand will give you a huge leg-up on learning skills well and making solid, presentable projects, which will help you significantly when job hunting.Read Less','ironhack'),(678,239344,'IronHack is great','2018-04-10',0,5,5,5,5,'The web dev course was great.

This course will NOT be easy, but do not let that discourage you! As everything else in life you get out what you put in. From my experience the students that would log the hours doing the course\'s excercises and learn on their own had the best portfolio. Having a great portfolio translates to...job offers!!! (Log those hours behind the screen and build something damn it!)Ironhack StaffIn short the staff is excellent. Remember they are there to ensure your success. The coding bootcamp model only works with the success of each and every student. Their whole business model depends on the students\' success, therefore they bend over backwards to make sure we are not only happy but successful. Special thanks to my professors (Alan + Nick) and TA\'s (Sandra + Gus). My success was a direct reflection of your hardwork.Classroom EnvironmentThe classroom environment is built to facilitate creative learning. Building.Co provides a nice shared workspace that helps foster a sence of community. The 3rd floor patio is a nice getaway even in the middle of downtown. Lastly, there is beer on tap. This is especially nice to relax and network with classmates. OverallIronhack has helped me become more niche (valuable) in the tech industry. I am extremely impressed with the overall product they provide. I have a Master\'s Degree and this bootcamp made me more valuable in 6 months then my previous 6 years of education.

The staff was very friendly, but seemed to be a bit desorginzed. I say this because there where several trips and exchanges of personal, which didn\'t leave much time for us to get to know them and learn from them.One thing I would advise strongly, which I think was a big error in my experience, is to never leave the cohort with less than 1 instructor and 2 TA\'s. Unfortunatley in our last two weeks, which coincided with the two weeks we had to prepare our final projects, our teacher left every day at 1pm, and didn\'t help much during the morning he was there, and one of our TA\'s took another position within Ironhack, which left just one person helping a class of 20. This was extremly unfair, for everybody had doubts and needed help, but there was only one person to clear them. Thankfully in the second week a new TA joined the class, but even though he had good predisposition, he had not been with the cohort during the whole course, so the amount of help he could provide was different.Still, taking the good and the bad, I think I learnd a lot, and I\'m happy with the experience.Read Less','ironhack'),(681,238866,'Thanks to Ironhack, I was able to be part of the UX/UI world!','2018-04-09',0,5,5,5,5,'During February and March I\'ve coursed the UX/UI Bootcamp in Ironhack.

Learn latest technologies The school is... Read More aware of how the market evolves. That’s why in previous editions they’ve teach Ruby on Rails or React. Don’t worry on the technology, just trust them, companies are always interested for the latest techs as they are trying to get updated.  I was surprised to see that even programmers with 10 years experience were joining the bootcamp to get updated on technologies. Companies will value those learning’s, don’t worry. 2.	A dedicated team that encourages learning At Ironhack I’ve coded next to smart and passionate teachers. I was surprised by 6:30pm after 9 hours coding they were there teaching me last details of the lesson I hadn’t understood or even helping me improve my projects. One teacher and three assistants on the full-time bootcamp, where else are you gonna find that much support?! Moreover, the rest of the staff is unbelievably friendly and supportive. They will weekly ask you for feedback and make that you feel like at home (that’s for example how we got our BBQ at the rooftop and a Ping-Pong table) :D. Believe me you’re gonna get surrounded by an awesome atmosphere. Staff takes very seriously on QUALITY, proved through the learning units, IT events, job placement, fully equipped kitchen and much more. 3.	Hiring week Compared to other bootcamps or online courses, Ironhack were the only ones offering some kind of direct shortcut for placement. Last week you have the opportunity to get interviewed by 20-30 companies. They do not assure you to get a job, but definitely you’ll have an experience on how to deal and prepare for technical interview. You won’t lack of a job on IT field if you work on your skills.4.	Awesome classmates This will depend on every cohort. Usually Barcelona attracts people from all around the world (in my cohort: Canadians, Italians, Germans, Austrians, Caribbean, Portuguese and of course Spaniards). Sincerely, I am gonna miss my mates a lot. They were the reason and the necessary support to keep coding by 8:00pm, when all what your head whisper to you is: “Go home!” We’ve spend great time together having Ironbeers, roomscape, music festivals, lunch at the restaurant (of course, most of it on weekends, week if for coding haha). I also want to thank the UI/UX students. We’ve had the opportunity to collaborate at some point and also see their projects as they have seen and advice on ours. We’ve also had true programmers coming from different industries to evaluate our projects in order to decide for the three contestants that deserve to present in the Hackshow. All this makes the experience much more complete and close to the real working world.5.	Coding bootcamp, online courses or autonomous learning at home? I speak from personal experience: I’ve tried learning from home, but then if you get blocked maybe you can spend 4 hours with no clues. That gets soon very frustrating and increases the chance you give up with code. That’s not how it is supposed to be in the working environment. You’ll probably get great contents with other online courses, but as soon as you want to go further you may face technical problems. At Ironhack, teachers give you the right support to be little bit creative at the same time they train you with all the basics to be able to continue your own-training after the bootcamp. 6.	Full-time or Part-time Both are great! Part-time will require you the endurance to go coding after your other regular timetable that you follow, but also full time will challenge you 9:00 to 21:00 for 9 intensive weeks… be ready to abandon all other social compromises that are not having beers with your Ironmates!  Part-time also allows you to develop your projects more calmly (as you have almost one month to deliver each one of the final projects), but then it will depend on your discipline to commit to work even at home.

In the review I try to stress out why Ironhack is the right choice for you. Enjoy the read : )TEACHERS &amp; CURRICULUMI couldn’t think of better teachers than the ones from Ironhack. Learning from Andre, our main teacher, was an incredibly valuable experience. He is not at all comparable to any other teacher I met in the course of my academic journey. He is inspiring, incredibly skilled and knowledgeable in all realms of the industry. The same applies to the great technical assistants. Everyone is really eager to help you and motivate you throughout the course. I don’t want to sugarcoat anything, the curriculum is intense and your personal outcome also depends a lot on yourself and how much effort you put in. Be consistent and don’t stress out when you don’t get a concept right a way. You will get there with sufficient practice. As Andre taught us, they give us the shoes; we are the ones to put them on. Apart from the curriculum, you will have the chance to educate yourself in related fields. Almost everyday there are events, lectures and workshops that you can attend. BARCELONA OPEN SPACEWhen it comes to the right location for you to attend a bootcamp, Barcelona is definitely the place to be; the city is vibrant, young and is known for its growing tech scene. I recommend you to make use of all the great facilities that the Ironhack office provides. You’ll have the possibility to be at Ironhack 24/7. The open space with all its facilities offers you the perfect place to unfold your potential and really immerse into the world of programming. There is also a flat upstairs with a nice rooftop to study and have a barbecue with your IH friends to unwind after hours of learning and coding. The staff really trusts you guys and gives you all the freedom you need to feel as comfortable as possible. They are all really attentive to your needs and are very perceptive to any feedback. In general, the staff is always friendly and always approachable with whatever question you have.JOB PERSPECTIVESRegarding job perspectives, it is a bit too soon to be opinionated since it’s two days since the bootcamp is over. However, if it helps you to get an idea, everyone from the previous cohort landed a developer job before our cohort ended. The placement manager as well as the rest of the team are really supportive and provide help with your portfolio. Also, the hiring week at the end of the bootcamp will help you to get in touch with different tech companies in Barcelona. PREPARATIONI’d like to make a short remark for those of you who have no prior knowledge. Although the program does not require any prior preparation besides the pre-work, I strongly recommend you to prepare yourself upfront using free online resources with main focus on JavaScript. It will keep your frustration level lower in case you are starting from scratch. However, don’t feel intimidated by this, it is not required and you can go along without any pre-knowledge.IRONHACK FAMLast but not least, I would like to address a very special thing about the program. When applying for Ironhack, I mainly focused on the learning experience itself and haven’t thought so much about the positive factors that this course brings along. But believe me, it’s the piiiiipool that make this experience so unforgettable! Although you might think that 2 1/2 months are a pretty short time to build close relationships, the bootcamp will prove you wrong!! You will have an amazing time with amazing likeminded people and will grow close together as a group. The group dynamics were unbelievable. We did a lot of different activities where everybody was included from day 1. We had legendary Friday nights, did rooftop BBQs, ping pong tournaments, samba nights, skiing trips and so much more).

Read More que he tomado y estoy super orgulloso de haberlo hecho.Para los que quieran una review con mas información intentaré hacer hincapié en los puntos fuertes de este Bootcamp:1- El temario: No solamente te enseñan a programar desde 0 sino que te preparan para ser autosuficiente una vez acabado el bootcamp. Me explico: En Ironhack aprendes MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express,Stack Angular, Node) + HTML5 &amp; CSS. Y esos conceptos aún con el poco tiempo con el que disponemos, arraigan en tu cerebro como si llevaras meses estudiándolos. Yo tenía un poco de Background en temas de CSS y HTML y en la primera semana ya estaba aprendiendo cosas nuevas que no sabía.Una vez acabado el Bootcamp puede estudiar cualquier tecnología de manera autosuficiente. Esa seguridad que te da el aprender cosas nuevas y saber que puedes hacerlo, no tiene precio.2- El equipo: Teacher &amp; Ta\'s.- Decir impresionante, me quedaría corto, por lo que voy a decir únicamente que somos unos afortunados por tener a estos profesionales enseñándonos todos los días. André es una bestia en lo que a conceptos y manera de enseñar se refiere, personalmente es una persona muy cercana y se puede hablar con él de cualquier cosa. Sabe transmitir los conceptos de una manera sencilla y fácil de entender, y creedme, en este mundo no es nada fácil. Los TA\'s (teacher assistant) están ahí en cada momento en el que necesitamos ayuda y nos quedamos atascados en algún ejercicio y/o proyecto. 3. La familia Ironhack.- Desde el primer momento nos sentimos cómo en casa, nos dijeron que pasaríamos más horas ahí que en nuestra propia casa (no me lo creí al principio, pero... si, es cierto). Y es que al final, preferías quedarte aquí con tus amigos trabajando que irte a casa a hacerlo solo.El staff que está con nosotros es impresionante, desde el primer día te cuidan para que estés a gusto. Nunca han tenido una mala palabra, ni un gesto raro, ni una mirada especial. Estoy encantado de haberl@s conocido a tod@s, no sería lo mismo si no estuvieran aquí.Las instalaciones son perfectas para el tipo de trabajo que estamos desarrollando aquí. Si tuviera que hacer mi propio Ironhack lo haría de la misma forma que lo hacen ellos, cada centímetro está pensado a la perfección para que los que estamos estudiando aquí como los que trabajan estén a gusto.Finalmente y una de las cosas que me llevo y recordaré toda mi vida; los compañeros. Desde el principio congeniamos muy bien, la mayoría de nosotros estamos aquí para dar un cambio a nuestra vida laboral y en su efecto a nuestra vida en general. Tenemos muchas cosas en común y somos muy parecidos en la manera de ser (algunos más y otros menos) pero con el equilibrio que en todo sitio se necesita. Hacemos actividades conjuntas casi cada día (no es obligatorio!), desde Cervezas cada Viernes(y su fiesta posterior) hasta BBQ los fines de semana, Scape Rooms y visitas por la ciudad.Finalmente, si has llegado hasta aquí es porque lo estás pensando muy seriamente, no lo dudes.

They are patient and are genuinely interested in your growth. Nizar was our instructor for our bootcamp who is hands down one of the most talented instructors I’ve met. He is able to meet you where you are and is accommodating to your needs in the classroom. It’s easy to feel incompetent in such a large subject that is completely new, but Nizar and his team do a great job of making you feel comfortable in a challenging space. He also has a gift for teaching students with all backgrounds and will meet you where you are in your understanding. The bootcamp is intense, but it’s well worth the time spent there. I came out with confidence in my new skills even though I knew I had a lot more to learn. The bootcamp provides you a great foundation along with a large network of talented individuals who are more than willing to help you navigate through the tech realm as many are completely new to this space.

I haven’t written anything besides code in the past three months, and the longest piece of text I’ve typed recently was a string for a database. So how do I begin with this one…As a foreword of sorts, I didn’t know a thing about coding before... Read More I decided to apply for Ironhack’s Web Development Bootcamp. I had seen pieces of code before, and I could understand them just as well as ancient Egyptian. Until then, I had worked in the fields of journalism and communications, but if you have paid any attention to the world and its changes, you won’t need me to tell you about how hard it has become to make a career- and a living- in that sector nowadays.What I’m trying to convey is that, at first, coding was my Plan B, a way to escape unemployment and get back on track- but I had no idea if I could handle it, or if I was going to enjoy it at all. And (to my own surprise), not only did I make it, it also seems that I enjoy coding- although it still gives me the occasional headache. It might feel like I’m rambling, and I apologize- but there is a point in all of this. Like myself, many consider going into coding, but they wonder if it’ll be the right thing for them, if they will struggle trying to understand how code works. And I’ve come to find that you don’t require an intensive technical background to become a web developer or programmer. True, you need to tackle problems with a very different mentality compared to other trades, often needing to examine the task from every angle and understanding exactly what you will require, and what items will be involved, before you write the very first line of code. But once you adopt that mindset, code becomes less of a threat and more of a puzzle that challenges you and ignites your curiosity.Getting used to this new strategic, however, is just the first milestone that you will have to conquer. Our worst enemy during the bootcamp wasn’t Javascript, Angular or any other framework- it was frustration. The pace of the lessons rarely gave us time to catch our breath, and the daily exercises (both individual, and in pairs) would often test our limits. On a couple of evenings, I found myself with my head buried between my hands in a moment of panic, telling myself “I can’t do this, I wasn’t ready for something like this”, and I wasn’t the only one. If I’m painting a bleak picture so far, don’t worry- I’ve resorted to the “bad news, good news” mechanic to save the best for later. Although intensive, the bootcamp (divided in three ‘modules’ of three weeks each, with a final project at the end of each one) helped me understand the basics of code in a very comprehensive way, starting with basic exercises and steadily increasing the number of iterations or the challenge they offered. The bootcamp covers many areas that are key for a developer including Javascript basics and advanced features, layouts and design, database management and package management to expand the possibilities of our frameworks- and yes, all of that sounds like a lot at first glance, but again, even a complete newbie like me managed to successfully complete the bootcamp.Now, my classmates and I are getting ready for the hiring week. For some of them, this will be a ‘level up’ in their career; for others, this is the start of a new one, and although I still have much to learn, I feel prepared to walk into web development with my head up high. And in addition to this, my final project -a website for musicians to find one another and start new bands and projects- became more than just a task to deliver at the end, and I have decided to continue working on it.

However, having mutliple Teacher Assistants and an excellent Head Teacher (Marc), alongside with cooperating for the completion of the daily exercises with the rest of students has made me learn the tools for building not only a simple website (which is pretty much what I was expecting from the course) but a proffessional platform. Managing databases, structuring projects, creating models, developping actions, building routes, designing the look of the platform and deploying the website once its done are a few of the core aspects of developping a website and at Ironhack they tackle each and every one of them in detail.

Consider what it might be like for you to balance IronHack with a full time job. Apply as early as you can, as mandatory prework is assigned for you to complete before the start of the course. It helps get you familiar with the material and be prepared before your first day. I completed mine over the course of a month (a few hours here and there), totalling about 40 hours to finish. There are expenses that you will incur that are not included in your tuition:Be prepared to pay for parking, as the school is located in Brickell. Parking is located on the street (estimated $2/hour) or in a nearby garage (flat fee $10/day)Also be prepared to have about $300 extra saved to download the software you need or for miscellaneous items (Sketch, Flinto, and I am forgetting the others at the moment) $50 for a FOB, which is a key for 24 hour access.

Trust me if I say that the whole Ironhack bootcamp has been one the highest ranking experiences of my life. Let me explain you why.Coding is hard. Learning to code in 2 months is very demanding... Read More and does seem totally impossible. Believe it or not, the Ironhack campus in BCN is designed at every level (from the location, the building itself, the staff, the teachers, the syllabus, the events and the job opportunities) just to make that happen. It doesn\'t get more ideal than that. Let\'s address these points one by one.Location: Barcelona is one of the most international cities in Europe. You do breath modernity and opportunity here, especially in the Poplenou neighboroud where the campus is located. It has become a kind of tech district, so on the way to class you pass by real tech companies and it gives you a feel of where you might end up working. Feels like you\'re there already.The campus: Fantastic open space with glass walls (Kanban boards drawn on them), plants hanging from the ceiling, kitchen, showers, desks, standing desks and tons of architectonic eye candies. It\'s like your mind expands in there, and you\'re hooked. You don\'t want to leave. In fact you don\'t. You\'re given the keys and take advantage of the 24/7 access policy. You\'ll need it on project weeks!!The staff: They\'re doing a fantastic job at keeping the place so well organized YET very informal, frienly and welcoming. I felt like I could express myself without having to fit in to any particular mould, and that was very valuable to me, because during the bootcamp you are reinventing yourself and pushing your brain hard on coursework in order to do that. So nobody will judge you if you spend hours by a standing desk coding and dancing looking more like a dj (or a crazy person) than a developer. You\'re tired? You can take a nap in plain sight. Wanna play? Let\'s skate or play football, inside of course. Nobody will ask you to stop. The staff is committed in having you become a web developer. They know kicking a ball will help your unconcious brain solve the kata.The teachers: Andre has been one of the most inspiring and influential professional I ever met. The guy has more than 20 years of experience, and he knows how to deliver it to you. His technical knowledge is so intimate that I\'m sure he natively thinks in Javascript then compiles in English for the rest of us. But it\'s not just that he tought us a programming language (and to love it), he focused a lot on best practices and the workflow and mindset you have to adopt in order to transform your ideas in to products through coding, and having fun in the process. Then, he passed on us so many insights drawing form his own experience, filtering out for us the most valuable. Maybe not obvious at first, but Andre insights sit on the brain and release value as time passes by. And also, it must be said: he let us appreciate how cool a fully fledged web dev can be. The teaching assistants: Ironhack employs the most suited students as teaching assistants for next cohorts. They\'re three, with different levels of experience depending on how many cohorts they survived. Yes, because it\'s not easy to stay patient having to debug horrible code by current students still not having a clue!! What you get from them is the closeness of relating with somebody who just finished the bootcamp, as well as accurate code revisions and debugging, directly from somebody who still remembers on what silly thing you\'re more likely to get stuck on. They were stuck there too just a couple of months before, they know how and where to help.The sillabus: Javascript is on fire nowadays and Ironhack is one of the few bootcamps to base its entire curriculum on it. Backend, frontend, all JS, because this is the present and the foreseable future of web dev. In fact, anything different would have felt like time wasting. The course is divided in three modules, each module giving you the teaching first and then challenging you on a project. The course material is constantly updated, you get exercises on a git repo to work on all night if you want. You\'ll get a detailed revision of your code in the morning. In the first module you learn the basics, HTML, CSS and JS, and make a late 90s style JQuerish app with it. Addictive brain gymnastics. Then you\'re introduced to Node.js in the second module, but server side. Mongo DB, Mongoose, Express. And you make a \'00 style server rendered MVC app, which almost feels like a real thing. In the third module you\'re thought a Javascript framework (this time it was Angular 5), and are given two weeks to complete your own full stack project. At some point while doing it, which happens at different stages for different people, it\'s guaranteed that you will see the light. Like in the Karate Kid movie you\'ll see how all they made you do click together. Your fingers begin flying on the keyboard, translating your thoughts in to code as if it was the most natural thing in the world, while you wonder what the hell is happening. That\'s when a web dev has finally emerged from within you. Events and job opportunities: Each week we had at least a couple of talks by external speakers, giving us insights from within the industry. That has been very valuable, the best one was somebody explaining us how to make a bot using Dialogflow, with git repo and all. Fantastic. Unfortunately, you are likely to be very fatigued by all the mental work you\'re doing in the bootcamp to fully engage in the talks. But it is all meterial you can go back at a later stage, having had direct exposure to it, and maybe even networked with a real tech-industry specimen. And we came to job opportunities. I yet have to attend the hiring week which is organized at the end of the bootcamp and it\'s supposed to be a kind of speed dating between us graduate and tech companies. BUT, during the last event one of the speakers gained an interest in my final project and we\'re now exploring the prospect of remote work for his creative, amazing and well established start-up. So yes, nothing concrete yet but I can\'t beleive the fact I\'m actively asked for interviews even BEFORE I start searching for a job. Amazing.Last point to address is the people. I barely been alone during these two months, the group spirit has been fantastic. From spending the night all together coding, to partying at campus on the weekends, I felt so fortunate to get to meet so many great people. On a personal note, that was even more important given the fact that I lost my father while I was attending the bootcamp. It wasn\'t an easy decision to stay and learn coding, but it was the right choice. The understanding and support I received from the staff and the other students has been invaluable, don\'t know what kind of place I would have been without it. I do reccomend the course, it delivers on expectations, but be ready to push yourself as hard as you can in the learning process. There\'s no magic, it all comes through hard work. Ironhack will provide you with the best environment, tools, knowledge, people, it\'s like a state of the art gym: the sweat is still all yours.

Llegamos al final de las dos semanas y nos toca hacer un proyecto con una pareja, me tocó con una persona muy afín a mi por lo que me sentí como pez en el agua y ofrecimos un buen trabajo. Es el final del segundo módulo, tengo una sensación de tristeza porque queda una semana de clase y después el proyecto de 2 semanas, más cerveza y relajando motores porque el segundo módulo fue muy arduo y doloroso.Finalmente atacamos la tercera semana, sentimos como si nos estuvieran metiendo a presión deprisa y corriendo Angular sin ser capaces de entender que significa la palabra ‘reutilizable’ pero ahí estamos en una semana aprendiendo todo lo posible aplicando Passport a nuestro proyecto, juntando todos los conocimientos que tuvimos para dar a luz a un proyecto que representaría el top de nuestro aprendizaje dejándote el sudor y rezando para que no te salga un ‘unexpected token fatal error’, para una vez más presentar tu proyecto, recibir un aplauso y…se acabó.¿De verdad, y las vivencias, gente, profesores, amigos?Si te contase las picarescas y las vivencias tanto positivas como negativas, ¿vivirías realmente lo que tienes que vivir o intentarías vivir lo que yo te contase?Sólo te daré un consejo nuevo alumno, no tengas prisa después de la hiring week, tardarán en contactarte porque así funcionan las empresas, pero finalmente te aseguro que conseguirás esa meta ansiada como es la de conseguir un buen puesto de trabajo, palabra de ironhacker.Read Less','ironhack'),(754,241826,'A year condensed in 9 weeks','2018-02-13',1,5,5,5,5,'I graduated from the Full-time Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid and I am very satisfied with the results.

In my case, not only were there 4 of them, but all four have insanely receptive qualities to make you feel comfortable enough to ask pretty much anything. Same goes for the rest of the staff.- on a professional level: perhaps the most important and differential factor, Ironhack has their own recruiter/laboral department that is commited to helping students find a workplace they\'ll enjoy once the 9 weeks are finished. May you find a job a week after finishing or not, they\'ll keep in touch with you (and I mean REALLY keep in touch, via slack or in person on a weekly basis) until you find something that fits you.On a final note i\'d like to emphasize this: what YOU get out of Ironhack does not depend entirely and exclusively on them. It will also depend on the personal interest and motivation you have. The chance to network with hundreds of students from previous editions on a weekly basis is a fail-proof way to see that the model just works.

I\'ve been pretty excited to write this review. Honestly, these reviews were what helped me make a decision and although I’ve never written a review before for anything, I knew this one I had to write.... Read More I wondered what I would be writing once I finished the course; and I have to say that probably midway through the course I already knew: Just do it.  So, this review has two parts two it: Before Ironhack and During Ironhack. I wanted to give my story so that you have some context and maybe it’s similar to your own story and helps you make a decision. And if that doesn’t matter to you, then just scroll down to the second part :) BEFORE IRONHACK Upon my college graduation (earning a degree in communications — so not technical at all), I found a job for a small company located in a WeWork while still holding a part-time job at a restaurant. At WeWork, naturally, the job feed was filled with posts for developers. I saw how much opportunity there was and I decided to play around with programming with many of the free resources online. After realizing that it was something I could pursue professionally, I decided to quit my job at the small company so that I can work full-time at the restaurant and study so that I can become a developer. (Working for a restaurant is not as mentally strenuous as an office, so I figured I can at least make a living and study.) Fast-forward a year. I was still working at the restaurant and I was still studying. I missed my personal deadlines and extended deadlines before I thought going to a bootcamp would be a good choice. I was really reluctant to do a bootcamp because, honestly, the information is freely available out there so why should anyone pay for it. But I realized that the money that I would have saved by studying on my own, I already lost. If I had done the camp sooner, I could have had a job in tech sooner and I could have made back my investment already. Granted, some people can study this own their own and that’s awesome; I, however, am not one of these people. I could say that my only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner, but, honestly, I’m glad I ended up in the cohort I did because I met some amazing people that greatly impacted my experience.  DURING IRONHACK Oh man. The first week wasn’t bad. We went over material that I had covered on my own so I felt pretty confident. The week after that? Yeah, things got harder. What’s interesting about the experience is that some concepts will just click and you’ll feel good about what you learned that day. Other days, some concepts just won’t click and you’ll leave with a pounding headache and feeling defeated. But you’ll come back the next day. You’ll go over that concept again — while learning a new one — and you’ll keep doing that. Eventually, it just clicks — but I really have to give thanks to Nizar, our instructor, for helping that happen. Nizar knew our weak points and knew what he was going to have to go over and over again. Sometimes he sounded repetitive, but the man knew what he was doing. A little more about Nizar — he is an incredibly talented teacher. When you ask him questions, he won’t just give you the answer. He’ll guide you so that you arrive to the answer. And like I mentioned before, he knows students’ trouble spots. Sometimes he would jump through certain bits of the curriculum because he knew it would be better for our learning. He was even willing to give us extra time — during our final project week, we stayed with some of us until midnight helping put out all our fires. He didn’t have to do that. And I think the other amazing thing is that he was always encouraging you. He could tell that sometimes I would get frustrated, and he would just remind me kindly/matter-of-factly, “It’s going to get easier with time.” The rest of the staff at Ironhack is amazing too. They’re all so interested in making sure that you have the best possible experience; granted, it\'s in their best interest to put out the best quality product, but they work hard at it and they know you’re here to change your life and they don’t take that lightly. They do weekly surveys so that they can constantly improve. They don’t just treat you like customers but like friends, sharing with you about their lives and experiences. And overall, they’re just genuine people which adds positivity to the environment. Another staff member you’ll be interacting a lot with is Brito. He’s going to become more important later on in the course as you start getting ready to go to market. And, of course, he becomes really important as you actually go to market. The guy has a ton of connections (and he wants you to exploit them) and he is there to help you (and he will help you) — you just have to do your homework. (Some students got hired before we even graduated because of his contacts.) He is also the guy to tell it like it is — and that’s exactly what you want with someone who is supposed to help you land a job. Another amazing thing about Ironhack is the environment. But again, the environment is founded on the people. You get to go everyday to this awesome co-working space surrounded by like-minded individuals. People who have decided to make a change in their lives and just go for it. That momentum is was catapulted my learning. I had peers who I could turn to when I needed help or they turned to me for help. You have an amazing support group for when you’re down and wonderful people to laugh with when you need a little break when you’re staying until 10 or 11 pm coding away. It’s really hard to find that and Ironhack has found it. Overall, I wouldn’t trade my experience at Ironhack for anything. The environment is awesome, the staff is awesome, and the material is awesome. But the most important thing I learned (and I know you’ve already read this) is how to learn. Even with that year that I spent learning on my own and even taking a paid course at MDC, I learned more at Ironhack after the first week. This is just the tip of the iceberg and there is so much more to learn, but now I can build and learn while I do it. Do research, make a change, and give it your all.

Maite always maintained a professional attitude and never displayed disappointment in the class or any student -she always maintained a sense of inspiration and the class responded to her instruction with universal admiration.

I would highly recommend Ironhack in an instant to anyone looking for a coding school or UX/UI design school- I can\'t imagine any school surpassing the standard the instrcutors and staff set at Ironhack- they are beyond reproach.Keri was the other part of the success myself and the other students achieved at Ironhack as she was the teachers assistant for our class. Keri teamed with Maite to form an unbeatable combination of class instruction........if any student needed clarification on any aspect of class instruction, Keri was always ready with a smile-never showing a hint of despair.

Keri displayed complete mastery of UX/UI design principles and eagerly helped at a moments notice, she clearly has the qulaities of a top level instructor.Brito is the Placements Manager and I\'ve yet to see anyone more passionate about matching students with carreers. Brito is often found running around the school creating/maintaining contacts for carreer fairs to ensure every student has the maximum chance of successful job placement. He is a core component to student success with unmatched connections in the Miami tech industry and is highly regarded and respected. Brito always maintains a level of approachbility and availablity and is 100% committed to matching up students with the correct potential employers. Students normally interact with Brito near graduation time as he interviews every student and forms a relationship and pairs student traits to the best matching employers. He clearly takes great pride in his success rate in matching students to carreers and truly enjoys his role in student\'s success. The Ironhack staff was always courteous and approachable. The staff actually knows every student by name and always maintains a level of friendship that is difficult to describe. On 1st day of enrollment- the entire staff meets with all the students and engages in name games to enhance name recollection- this is an ingenious concept to student introduction and clearly works as the staff calls everyone by name! The school has a very \'informal- tech startup\' feel which is likely intentional and helps foster an enviornement of learning and friendliness.The classroom environment also featured a tech startup feel with it\'s glass walls and sense of openess to staff and students alike. I would not change a thing to the learning enviornement, it was pleasing and provided a relaxed feel.My experience at Irohack was completely positive- the instruction and curriculum was flawless and the staff was always friendly. Ironhack sends weekly e-mail \'surveys\' asking how they might improve the school or staff and it was difficult in making such recommendations. My suggestion was to add a soda machine to the upstairs kitchen as I don\'t drink coffee or beer!Ironhack is more than a school- it is a place where life-long friendships are formed and fostered. Both students and staff alike bond in a unique way I was not expecting and this sense was echoed by my fellow classmates.

If you look me up in Medium, over the holidays I will be posting a much longer post on how I made the decision to get into UX. Many folks have learned and... Read More practiced design and web development on their own. Make no mistake, it can be done - but since I don\'t have a design background, I wanted a program that could guide my learning. But guess what - all of the other 8 students in the class had a design background of some sort and they found it worth to take the course as well.The thing about design is that it\'s more than just making something look good. It\'s about knowing how to solve a specific problem, applying best practices, AND making it look good. And you can\'t do that in a vacuum, you need others to critique your work, you need to know how to work with clients and you need to know how to work with developers. And that\'s what Ironhack exposes you too.Before taking the course I read reviews not just about Ironhack, but about coding and design bootcamps in general, and some of the reviews were pretty bad. Some said they didn\'t prepare you for an actual job in the real world, that they were just diploma mills and wanted your money. I can\'t speak for the other bootcamps out there, but Ironhack is ballin\'.Finally, I am from Washington, D.C., relocating to Miami. Getting into Miami Tech seemed daunting; I didn\'t know anyone, didn\'t know what companies were hiring, didn\'t know any contacts. And now that I\'ve just graduated, I can say while looking for a job is still a challenge, it is in no way daunting. I know my stuff and I know what\'s out there.About IronhackBefore applying for the course, I visited Ironhack and one other bootcamp in Miami in person. Ironhack is located at Building.co, a coworking space in Brickell (downtown Miami). Right now I\'m typing this to you from the rooftop patio on the third floor. It\'s baller. More importantly, our classrooms are nestled in between real tech companies that occupy space in the building. At least once a week I run into the startup founder that won Refresh Miami\'s Tech Demo Day in October. I\'m not just learning about tech, I\'m bathing in it. Furthermore, the vibe here is just different. I feel like I\'m wanted here, like I belong here. I\'ve made what I think will be lifelong friends. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the staff here is just... the real deal. Really. And they\'re respected in Miami Tech - I know this from attending networking events and mentioning that I\'m an Ironhack student. I\'ve only gotten positive responses from saying that.Alia, the GM, personally called me to congratulate me on getting into the program. When my wife came to visit the course one day, she welcomed her as if she was another student. You can\'t fake that.Brito, the placements manager, is so well connected he probably knows Barack Obama and Obama doesn\'t even live in Miami. And he\'s sincerely interested in our success.Marisa, the program manager, and Pat, the admissions manager, are similarly supportive and friendly. And finally, for the UX/UI fulltime bootcamp this past fall, we had the most amazing Instructors, Maite and Kerri. Maite had done UX in Paris, London and I think New York and is world class. Seriously. She eats, sleeps, drinks UX. Like I\'m almost worried for her sometimes that she needs to get to the beach more. :-) . She pushed us very hard to be our best, yet I knew every day she cared for us. You can\'t fake that.Keri, our TA, had completed the course previously and was the cheerleader we all need when completing a program like this. It\'s hard. If you give it the level of effort you need to be a great designer, it\'s even harder. And she was always there, answering our questions and encouraging us through frustration. In ConclusionI don\'t know what the future holds. There are no guarantees. I know it\'s hard out there. But as far as it relates to my professional life, where we all spend the majority of our days, I\'m more hopeful than I\'ve been in a long time.Whether you choose to do a bootcamp or not or Ironhack or not, if you\'re reading this I hope you find peace and meaning in whatever you do, and live courageously enough to work through fear and pain to better yourself and others.Don\'t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it.

The staff at Ironhack is very passionate and always willing to help or give advice if needed.

The reason I write the above first is because that is what I saw in several reviews I had read... Read More when searching for the right bootcamp. Yet, every time I would always think to myself, Is that really the truth, though? Will I regret making the jump? So before I write the rest of my review, I can tell you that those reviews were right!Before joining Ironhack, I was working at a digital marketing company in operations and product development (and before then I had just graduated with a bachelor in Architecture), so clearly I had zero coding experience prior to Ironhack. After about a year of debating whether I wanted to make a career change, I found Ironhack. I put my fear aside and reached out to ask for a campus tour here in Miami to get the ball rolling.Application Process: The first person I met at Ironhack was Alia, and Alia does NOT dissapoint! I felt such a great energy from her and genuine interest in getting to know me and understanding why I wanted to join their program. Shortly after, I applied and scheduled my three interviews (general interview with admissions, career interview with Brito, and a technical interview where you must solve a coding challenge). All three interviews went great (again...the only experience I had was working with developers, but never the actual coding aspect). The moment I received a phone call from Alia that I was accepted into the program I immediately felt two things: extreme excitement with a side of fear of what did I just get myself into.Cohort (9 weeks): The structure of the class is exactly as they describe it on the site. Grab your coffee in the morning, learn, code, lunch, learn and code (did I mention the coffee is free and unlimited?!). What really made the course, though, was our instructor Nizar and we were so lucky to have him! The way he explains the concepts is very clear for the most part and, to someone with no coding experience, I was able to understand what he was teaching. He never says no when you need help, and what\'s great about it is that he doesn\'t just hand the answers to you. He makes you think about what it is you\'re doing and what you need to do to get there. Now, I\'m not saying your journey will be easy, because it won\'t be. You need to put in the time inside and outside of class to make sure you\'re not falling behind. The course moves quickly, so it\'s very easy to fall behind if you\'re not keeping up. You will feel like (and I can only speak from the perspective of someone with zero coding experience), Holy crap, there is an entire universe of coding that I did not know about, but don\'t get overwhelmed! Don\'t let it discourage you, but do expect to be learning for the rest of your life as we all know how quickly technology can change. Finding a job: Brito, the recruitment manager at Ironhack, is also someone you will meet and never forget. Keep in mind, he is not there to hand you a guaranteed job on a silver platter at the end of the cohort - and he will make that very clear. He does a great job of coaching you on what networking events you should attend, what you need in your LinkedIn and in your resume, and is available whenever if you have any questions or need help. There is also a hiring fair where companies come in to sit and interview with you, I have yet to experience it as our fair is not until January, but it\'s great to know that we get the opportunity (thanks to Brito) to have that chance of speed-dating with several companies who are looking to hire.Overall, my experience was amazing. I don\'t regret making the jump and am lucky to have been able to attend Ironhack. For the past 9 weeks it never felt like I was going to school and I was always excited to go in the next day to learn something new.

What I came to realize, is the initial investment in a coding bootcamp, is exactly that … an INVESTMENT in yourself. Forget investing in other things that you have little control over, because the best choice you can make is investing in yourself by investing in your own education. I did weeks of research prior to joining Ironhack, and without any doubt it is the best coding bootcamp in Miami. I never felt like anyone was being fake with me, I never felt like I was being treated like a “number” in some education mill … this is absolutely nothing like that. My professor was Nizar and he was extremely intelligent, kind, and was accessible at all times. The whole staff is. One of the cool things about Ironhack, is witnessing staff members like Nizar, Brito, and even guest speakers, just staying for hours after their shift ends to teach and talk more with fellow students… When you see these things, you come to realize that Nizar, Brito, the guest speakers, all help because they truly love their job. I think thats really the key difference your going to find, its like this perfect crew of people who love what they do, are passionate, and love playing a key role in helping others in their journey to success.

I gave my explanation as to why I wanted to do it and they proceeded to give me a detailed account of what my everyday schedule would be like and the amount of work that would be required of me if accepted.

This man will not steer you wrong, and as long as you\'re putting in the work Brito is going to bend over backwards to make sure you find a job that is right for you.

Like anything in life the you have to do the work, but my Ironhack family definitly made so much possible. The most important tool that I learned at Ironhack was how to LEARN. You can\'t expect to become a the best developer in 9 weeks, but you can expect you will graduate with knowledge on how to become one! If you put in the work, I can guarantee you this. Nizar, our lead instructor is the man! The guy is legit one of the smartest people I\'ve met, and one of the most patient as well! Trust me, dealing with me is no easy task. However, he was always there for me, and like I mentioned above, he even answered my questions on a Sunday. Rarely (very rarely) will he give you the answer to your problems directly, he does much more for you, he tells you how to be resourceful and where to look or something along those lines. You end up solving the problem on your own and because of this, you learn so much more. The whole teaching staff is amazing, Ironhack always have great T.A.s. Our T.A. Dappered dan was the man. He was also always accessible.The experience does not end there. At Ironhack, they have a placement manager. His name is Daniel Brito. What do you need to know?

His background makes him the most qualified person for the role. His been on both sides of the table when it comes to hiring. If you decide to take the course, make sure you follow his every word. Why? Well I did, and I had a job before the cohort ended. He will also never write your resume for you or give you an answer directly, but you can expect the most detailed feedback you could ever imagine.

You get out what you put in - the program is intense and ultimately the students who get the most are those who stay the latest and work the hardest.Between the teachers, the other Ironhack students and the friendly office team the atmosphere was fantastic. Events were organised regularly to get to know different parts of the Tech sector and life as an engineer, as well as to party and have fun with other students - there are always an ample supply of beers available for students to enjoy after classes.In terms of value, Ironhack was the best educational experience I\'ve had (for comparison I have degrees from Oxford, University of Edinburgh, IE University in Madrid)I received 5 interview job offers before the Ironhack hiring day the following week, and several more at the hiring day. In terms of salary from low to high these were between a job as a front-end developer start-up in Barcelona for €20,000, a full stack engineer in an established international company in Barcelona at €30,000 a year or at a Dutch company in Amsterdam for €50,000. All with ample opportunities to learn. In terms of working as a freelancer, I was also contacted by a UK agency offering 300GBP a day to work as a remote developer. As I said above, I worked one of the highest in my cohort - those who put in similar efforts saw similar rewards though.You\'ll learn skills which will help you your entire life, especially how to learn new technologies: in the four weeks after finishing I built applications with Ruby on Rails and Elixir/Phoenix, as well as using Javascript Libraries and frameworks I\'d never even heard of during my time in Ironhack. Ironhack is not perfect. Don\'t come if you expect perfection; come to learn how to deal with real life situations. Sometimes the content is outdated --- just like happens in every programming job --- programming language change; sometimes things don\'t happen as expected; learn to deal with it. That\'s real life. The only thing I would say does not reflect real work is the lack of attention to testing. I don\'t think the importance of testing was impressed upon us - certainly in my cohort the one module that related to testing was treated as optional/an annoyance, and we were never taught principles of TDD or who to write a test. If it were up to me, I would have at least one of the portfolio projects have a small scope, but by developed through TDD. I think students would find more, and better paying jobs and ultimately be better developers because of it.Read Less','ironhack'),(803,240102,'The best learning experience','2017-11-30',0,5,5,5,5,'Ironhack has a customized approach to education based in its teaching practice.

I had reached a point... Read More where I was tired of working stagnant retail and call center jobs, and wanted to see if I could really turn my hobby into a career.Shortly after moving to Florida, I had been told about Ironhack from a friend and figured I may as well apply. Alia had contacted me back within about 15 minutes, and I was scheduled to come in a few days later. The interview process was not complicated, and the staff I spoke with did a great job of outlining the program. My biggest concern was that without having a college degree, and without any previous work experience, that a program like this still wouldn\'t help me, however Daniel Brito did a great job of explaining how to work around those things. I had also been doubting that I would have the bare minimum skill needed to pass the technical interview, which ended up going well (So don\'t doubt yourself on this!).  From the very first week, week 0, I decided I would start showing up to finish up some of the online prework that was assigned before the course started, this was the first time I met Kevin, on of the TAs, who was very friendly, and had a manner of encouraging learning without just handing you answers.  After the first week started our primary instructor Nizar gave us a run down of what our schedule was going to look like, and I\'ll admit it was intimidating. Nizar however, had a manner of teaching that made the fact that we were learning a LOT more enjoyable than stressful. In addition to that, the TAs Kevin and Ariel both out host break-out sessions throughout the week to focus on different concepts that some were struggling with, and held these sessions in a way that students would also be able to participate. To compliment the technical side of learning the skills needed to become a software developer, Daniel Brito also regularly would teach us the Ins-and-Outs of the career side: Networking skills, community events, resume building, etc. and this was something that was very unique and welcomed. I had expected this to be like most traditional schools where they will teach you skills and concepts, but will leave you on your own when it comes to getting employed for those skills. This also brought about the possibility of learning beyond the scope of the Ironhack curriculum, as we were actively encouraged to attend events and meet people in the tech scene who were established developers, entrepreneurs and startup founders who also were willing to share their knowledge, some working in the same building as Ironhack was located.  Now with all those pros being said, it should be noted that while not exactly a con there are some things to keep in mind: They call this a bootcamp, and that is a very accurate word to describe it. It\'s not easy, but it\'s not impossible either. Unlike traditional schooling, you wont get a degree for simply showing up and goofing off. We had to do projects that applied everything we learned, and the time given to complete these project was 1 week, and then they had to be presented to both the class, and occasionally other people who were in the building. Before Ironhack, I had written some scripts and small programs for fun, but they were never seen by anyone, and now I had to not only show it to my instructors, but to several people?! It stands as one of the most stressful things that I would gladly do again. What was great about this though is that it conditions you for what is expected of you in the industry, and by the end, these presentations were more fun than stressful. Ultimately Ironhack teaches you how to stand on your own in a relatively new and rapidly changing industry, and teaches you how to continue teaching yourself long after you leave the program, so that your skills will stay competitive. Nizar is a master of both writing code, and teaching it. Kevin and Ariel were great at encouraging us when we got stuck or stressed out, and also making things fun. Daniel Brito will make you into a rockstar when it comes to networking, job hunting, and building a presence for yourself in the tech community of your choice. Thanks to the well crafted curriculum, and the great staff, I\'ve now gone from a guy who had moved from working in aerospace to working at grocery stores and call centers, who wrote simple programs on the weekend for fun, to a Full Stack .Net Developer at a company who\'s 2 week development sprints are a walk in the park compared to the 1 week high-pressure sprints for Ironhack\'s projects.If you are on the fence about whether or not you should attend a program like this, and are serious about becoming a web developer by profession, then this program can change your life.Read Less','ironhack'),(807,239976,'Great experience!','2017-11-24',0,5,5,5,5,'I recently graduated from the UX/UI full-time bootcamp in Miami.

I wanted to be able to build applications to help my teams and clients, and knew that I had enough curiosity and perseverance to actually likely make it happen.This bootcamp is no walk in the park. I quit my job, didn\'t go out with friends, and focused as much of my energy as humanly possible on grasping the changing concepts. Each day we had a morning lesson, exercises, an afternoon lesson, and then a night project. While instructors did help those in the class that were falling behind, the class moves fast and you have to give it your all to progress. The instructors were not only an intelligent, hardworking group, they took care of each question that came about, and often stayed after hours to help with projects, going far above and beyond. The classmates were a driven bunch. It was exciting seeing each person, coming from vastly different backgrounds, excelling and struggling at different stages.After the bootcamp, we all make one final application during a 2 week sprint, and then present these to Ironhack and the community, a group of maybe 80-100. Afterwards networking happens and then its on you! I found a full stack web developer role a few months after graduation, through a recruiter friend of mine from back home.

You will learn the basics of full stack web development. You will learn how to make real, production applications.

Read More market.As a matter of fact, a bootcamp is very intense, so be prepared for a rough ride, with much knowledge to absorb, a good dose of frustration and a few doubting moments to overcome. True, the learning process is exhilarating at times and painful at other, but always keep the faith that with time and practice you will progress, understand and succeed. A bootcamp can fit many profiles from total newbies (as the former me) to people with some knowledge of computer science or that have already dabbled with programming. Hence, our cohort was quite heterogeneous in terms of levels and goals, but it created a healthy emulation where co-students and assistants were always supportive to students that were most challenged.Ultimately, as a student I am amazed by how much we have learned and achieved in a span of only 9 weeks. Yet, it is also very humbling to realise that there is still so much more to learn and that some advanced topics are just out of the reach of jr. devs. One thing I realised as well, is that programming is a craftsmanship that requires hours upon hours of practice and hands-on experience and no one can become a programmer overnight. Nevertheless, a bootcamp is simply the perfect kick-starter that will provide you with the basic skillset to be able to learn by yourself. Note that If your goal is to be recruited as a jr. dev after the bootcamp, which ws not my case, I strongly recommend that you enter the bootcamp as much prepared as possible (do online tutorials, watch YT vids, check as many resources as possible etc.).In a nutshell, I can assert that thanks to IronHack I have grown from code illiterate to code literate, which is truly life-changing.Hats off to the staff for, although we were only the second Parisian cohort, the bootcamp was already a fine-tuned machine very well connected with the French tech ecosystem. A very special mention to the teaching staff (teachers and assistants) who were extremely skilled and whose dedication was just out of this world...Pricing wise, definitely reasonably priced for its value and a well worth investment.Read Less','ironhack'),(826,239662,'The Best Experience','2017-11-19',0,5,5,5,5,'Lo que me animó a hacer Ironhack fue la necesidad de un cambio, la universidad me dio mucha teoría pero cero práctica y no me veía capaz de incorporarme al mundo laboral, tan adulto como me parecía.

I enrolled with the intent... Read More to only further my skills as a developer and put myself in a better position to enter the market as a professional but I walked away with so much more.Anyone throwing around the idea of joining a coding bootcamp has to do their due diligence and really be sure that they get all the information they can on the camp before committing. So as an alumni I am putting myself back in the shoes of a prospective student and will shed light into some of the pressing questions that are sure to be on the mind.Investment: Any coding camp is going to be a sizeable investment in not only money but time as well. Anyone who is toying with the idea of getting into coding and has not yet attempted to learn on their own is running the risk of losing on this investment. A prospective student should be absolutely sure that a coding camp is the right choice for them because the last thing you want to do is be tippy toeing around the idea of a life as a developer only to have gone through the bootcamp and realize that maybe it wasn’t all that you built it up to be in your mind. Look at all of the free resources (Google, YouTube, etc.) and at least attempt to learn on your own beforehand. A career in development is one that involves life long learning so I have to emphasize that you ask yourself if you are considering this bootcamp for the right reasons (i.e. genuine love for development and not the money chase).Curriculum: Ironhack is constantly keeping an eye on market trends with regards to the skills employers want in to see in Junior Developers. In 2017 they decided to take the web development curriculum from one that was Ruby centric to one that teaches Full Stack Web Development (MEAN) with Javascript. This right here is big because it makes you more attractive in the eyes of potential employees as the demand for these skills high and you are given the foundation to go off and build the next big application or at the very least understand how the most popular applications (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) are built.Course Instruction: Nizar Khalife (Lead Instructor for full time Web Development course) is an experienced developer with real world experience who has a wealth of knowledge and is more than willing to share it if you are willing to receive it. He Knows the material like the back of his hand and you are going to wish that you had more than 9 weeks to pick his brain to extract all of his wisdom.Career Placement: Daniel Brito (Placements Manager) is someone who you need to have as a professional contact as he knows just about everyone in the Miami Tech scene. He worked many years as a Senior IT recruiter so he knows exactly what employers are looking for in Junior Developers. He is also someone who will bend over backwards for you by not only placing employers in front of you but will also show you how to hustle your way into generating quality leads for yourself. His career services are invaluable and are not to be underutilized. Networking: Aside from technical skills, there is networking aspect that launches you right into the heart of the Miami Tech scene. Ironhack has been able to build relationships with major companies and industry leaders that you can easily leverage once you are a member of the Ironhack family; student or alumni. If landing a job as a developer after taking the course is your goal (which it should be), skill alone will not get your foot in the door (unless you are gifted with genius level abilities). You also have to network and make yourself be known in the eyes of the community and Ironhack is your ticket into it.Daniel Brito and Nizar Khalife are invaluable resources that make Ironhack what it is and make worth the cost of the bootcamp. However, they are not alone in making Ironhack the machine that it is. The rest of the staff are an absolute joy and you will never feel like you are just another dollar in the pockets of another organization. Everyone is extremely hands on and will go above and beyond to ensure that your experience is one that promotes your success.In my eyes, Ironhack is by far the best coding camp in South Florida that provides you will all the tools and resources needed to get a return on your investment.Read Less','ironhack'),(830,239722,'One of the Best Personal Decisions for my Life by Far','2017-11-17',0,5,5,5,5,'I will say that attending Ironhack’s 9 Week Web Development Course has been one of the best personal decisions for my life by far. This is not an exaggeration. I chose computer engineering as my major in college to make my parents proud; however, computer... Read More engineers are about signals and circuitry, and I could not see myself pursuing a career revolving around this. I spent 2 years stumbling to find a passion, and eventually, I found it in coding.As a disclaimer, prior to the bootcamp, I gain some coding experience from college, and while unemployed, I attempted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics through online resources, but I felt like my learning was sporadic and unstructured. I attempted to apply for programming jobs for six months, but after about 90 job applications, no one reached out to me. I felt discouraged, but I knew I needed to find guidance. Ironhack provided this guidance.The 9-week course was fast-paced even for a person with some coding background, so I strongly encourage students with no experience to learn basic JavaScript prior to the start date. The teacher, Nizar, was able to break down complex concepts into simple examples and analogies making them easier to understand. He also provided step-by-step implementation for web application examples. Each day, there are periodic breaks between lessons, so he and the TA can assist us throughout the class; therefore, everyone remains on the same page.The three projects at the end of each module were great opportunities for all of us to shine. I felt proud of my projects since the ideas came from myself, and I was the one (with some existence) who needed to break them down into coding solutions. Having a project at the end of each module helped solidify the skill sets learned in the current section and build on the previous skills. These projects were done in a short span of time (as short as one week) forcing us to learn project management skills.I had one issue that frustrated me and other students during project week. The length spent troubleshooting problems for individual students were far too long. Sometimes one student would take one or two hours of the teacher’s time fixing a feature while there was a queue of other students waiting for assistance. Because of this, during the final project week, I spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues on my own, and I was unable to complete most of the features in my project.After graduation, career week followed, and those seven days were very helpful. I learned strategies for job hunting, and I realized that those six months of no-follow-up job hunting was due to poor tactics. Our advisor, Brito, made sure to have multiple companies at our hiring fair. The hiring fair reminded me of speed dating where you only had twenty minutes per company! It was stressful and excited at the same time. From this hiring fair, I received 3 interviews, and I got an offer 2 weeks later. I am now an associate software engineer making twice as much money as I did a year ago, and honestly, I am excited about my career path as a developer.Read Less','ironhack'),(831,239701,'A Great Investment','2017-11-17',0,5,5,5,5,'My experience was amazing.

Here’s the TL;DR of my review of Ironhack in bullet points, but I highly encourage you to read the rest of the post if you’re... Read More considering attending this bootcamp and want to get an unfiltered and real opinion from a recent grad who now works full-time as a Software Engineer.First and foremost, if you’re going to go into the web dev program, it absolutely has to be because you feel genuinely passionate about this field and working as a developer one day. If you’re doing this for money, you’re doing it for the wrong reason and at some point during the program you will realize you hate what you’re doing and you wasted $11K.Daniel Brito (placements manager) and Nizar Khalife (head instructor for the full-time class) are absolute gold and two people you will learn a ridiculous amount of great things from. Without a doubt, these two guys alone are worth the cost of the Bootcamp and, quite frankly, without them Ironhack Miami wouldn’t be as solid. Listen to them, let them guide you, they do know what they’re doing. The rest of the staff are also very nice and friendly people.Remember that no bootcamp is some sort of magical experience — the end result and your overall success in it really boils down to the amount of effort that you put in. And you have to put in more effort than probably any other endeavor you’ve taken on in your life. This is no exaggeration. Everyone’s lives are different, but do whatever you can to enroll in the full-time cohort and not the part-time. Doing this stuff full-time ensures you will be significantly more focused and with less distractions. Trust me, this is critical.To elaborate some more, Ironhack is a great experience that will without a doubt push you to your limits and make you feel outside your comfort zone almost constantly. This is a good thing, and it also means that the more passionate you are about being a developer, the more you will learn and the less frustrated you will feel when you don’t understand something. One way to know if you enjoy doing this stuff every day is to prep yourself before you decide to enroll (lots of free resources out there, Google it). You do that by making a daily schedule (as in, 5-7 days a week) where you spend at least a few hours each day learning to code and problem solve using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on your own. Keep this up for a few weeks and you’ll get a better idea as to whether this is something you’d enjoy doing as a full-time job or not. If you walk into Ironhack with that level of commitment, you will definitely do well and you will also get along super well with Brito and Nizar. Brito in particular is someone who knows almost everyone in the tech community in South Florida, and he\'s also a great guy to talk to. He’s the person who will bend over backwards for you to help you find a job, help you grow your professional network, and give you all sorts of actually useful advice (no fluff or BS) on anything from job hunting, to résumé building, to how to talk to potential employers. But this is only going to happen if you’re dead serious about the program and finding a job afterwards. He is NOT there to do the work for you, you first gotta put in the effort, you gotta hustle, and you gotta love what you’re doing. Nizar is the one other person you want to listen to and learn from. The man has a substantial amount of real developer experience and the ability to almost glance at a problem and tell you what’s wrong with your code and what you can do to fix it. He’s also extremely patient and very good at helping you understand abstract concepts. Overall a fantastic instructor.All in all, this is the best bootcamp in South Florida, by a long shot. Ultimately, it’s up to you and no one else how successful you are in the program and whether you find a job at some point later. Brito and Nizar are priceless.

Read More was basically null, but I was starting a position as Software Engineer at an up-and-coming startup in Madrid, and I needed to learn as much as I could as fast as I could. Ironhack proved to be just the right thing for me. For the sake of organizing the review, I\'d like to split it in three parts: the Curriculum, the Experience, and the Staff.1. The CurriculumI do not want to get too deep into this because it has changed quite a bit since I did the course. My class was the last of the Ruby on Rails Generation. Nonetheless, the course was generic and conceptual enough that using other technologies, such as Node.js in my case at work, proved to be quite easy. They have since changed their curriculum to Node.js, which is a great idea in my opinion. You will come out having a broad enough knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be able to tackle the coolest web-dev projects you find on Github and, as well as a great notion on working with databases. You will definitely have the skillset necessary to build your own projects from scratch as well. I think the best way to define the learning process at Ironhack is that you gain the ability to explore and master the tools you need to build a web application. The stack they may use is no limiting factor. In essence, you get the wings you need to fly on your own through the web-dev universe.2. The ExperienceIt\'s intense. Even the part-time plan is challenging and demanding. For 6 months you will have to be strongly committed to the course, because how much you learn will depende entirely on you. Ironhack will provide the tools you need to get as far as you want to go, but the effort has to be there. The pacing is neither too fast, nor too slow, although you do have to work at home a bit if you want to keep up. If you come from a totally different background, or are writing your first lines of code, you\'ll probably need to work harder than people who are more familiar with code. But fear not, you will have awesome support from your classmates and teachers. You will be spending two days from 18 to 21, and Saturdays from 9 to 17 at Ironhack, so be prepared. Balancing the course with a full time job and your personal life is definitely possible, but you will certainly need the willpower to do it. The structure has changed since I did the course, I believe now it is more project based (three projects in total), and at the end you get to share your creations with your mates and with people from all over the community that come to the Hackshow. 3. The communityThis is, in my opinion, the greatest value in Ironhack. You will make great friends with your teachers, you will make great friends with your classmates, and will live an amazing experience carefully crafted by the entirety of the Ironhack team. You will be connected to the community before, during and after the course. There will be lunches, dinners, parties, hackshows, hackathons, talks and so much more to make the Ironhack experience that much more enriching. Every member of the Ironhack family, not just the teachers, is there to make the most of the program for the students, and it really shows. Also the space they have in Madrid is beautiful, making it a pleasure to go there work and spend time.Overall a great experience that I thoroughly recommend to anyone that want to dig into the world of app-building - whether you are thinking of a cool project, want a career change, or work in product and want to understand what the devs at your work do.

At the time, I was preparing to go to law school, but once I realized it wasn’t the right fit I had to re-group and figure out my next steps. I was working a very boring job in retail for about... Read More 8 months before Ironhack, so obviously I was eager to get started. I did a ton of research before committing. Needless to say, for many prospective students it can be daunting to put a pause on your career to take a risk on a bootcamp that may or may not live up to your expectations. In my first two rounds of interviews, Alia and Marisa immediately quelled these anxieties. The amount of care that the Ironhack staff puts into each cohort is unrivaled. Something I really admire about them is that they’re always working to improve the next cohort based on what they learned from the last group. The course was split up into the steps of the design thinking process, with a new instructor each week. 1 design sprint, 1 group project and 2 solo projects. This stood out to me in comparison to other design programs because it gives you the opportunity to show off the work you can do on your own as well as what you can contribute to a team. At one point you’ll be working on two projects at once (group and individual), but it’s very manageable. (My advice would be to document everything along the way via Medium posts so that you’re not scrambling at the end to put together your portfolio.) Our TA Horacio was always available to help us through any road blocks we hit along the way. Your cohort will be your greatest support system and will challenge you to work harder and smarter.  For hiring week, Brito gave us a choice of 15 employers to interview with. It’s up to you to choose the companies you want to sit down with, but I would highly recommend interviewing with as many as possible. Not because you’ll get a job out of the hiring fair, but because the interview practice you’ll get is an invaluable experience. Don’t worry about wasting the time of employers that you’re not serious about because several of the companies that came in during our hiring fair immediately told us they weren’t hiring. Regardless, the experience made me a pro at interviewing and gave me the confidence I needed to succeed in my interviews that followed. Even if you don’t get hired immediately, Brito makes it his mission to get you a job. I really appreciated all his support and advice throughout the job search process. He’ll help you through the gritty details of negotiating offers, writing follow up emails, and anything else you need to know along the way. He’s an invaluable resource, listen to him! I accepted an offer 3 weeks after my program ended. I couldn’t have done it without the support and care of Alia, Marisa, Danny, Brito, Horacio, and the rest of the amazing staff, instructors, and TAs at Ironhack. That said, you will not get a job just by taking this course. Work hard and listen to the advice from Brito, your instructors, your mentors, and even your classmates. “If you’re empathetic by nature, and you have a head for problem solving, along with a thorough understanding of general design principles and processes, a healthy combination of functional and aesthetic sensibilities, a willingness to learn, and you enjoy the work, there’s absolutely no reason you can’t quit your shit job as soon as possible, so that you might do what you were really born to do.”Read Less','ironhack'),(880,238412,'Web Dev Part-time','2017-10-02',0,4.7,5,4,5,'As a sophomore college student pursuing a Computer Science degree, I joined Ironhack with the purpose of fast-forwarding my start as a programmer, and that way I would get some real experience while finishing school.

I needed to add to my portfolio, tighten up my design skills, and meet more people in the industry.I knew I needed further education, but the question was what program or school could offer the results I needed in the fastest amount of time possible? Before I make any big decisions I research the heck out of everything, comparing, contrasting, emailing past clients or students in this case, and asking everyone I could on what they thought of the program I would be spending a good chunk of money on. I researched design programs in Atlanta, Chicago, and Texas, speaking with their advisors and asking a multitude of questions. None though were as genuine, honest, and optmistic as Alia Poonawala from Ironhack. I placed my application on a Monday morning, she called me the following Tuesday morning, requesting I come into a meeting later that day. She answered all my questions, even allowing me to briefly meet Daniel Brito, the Ironhack Placements manager and one of the most genuine/well connected humans I have ever met.I accepted the offer from Ironhack two days after the meeting, quit my job, and began my UX/UI journey for the next 3 months.The friends I\'ve made, students, mentors, and industry professionals, was something that I did not expect. THIS IS NOT ANTOTHER DESIGN MILL CHURNING OUT STUDENTS PEOPLE. This is a real community of designers, developers, and creative professionals coming together to help each other be the best they can be.The instructors who taught the course varied in design expertise, but all truly cared about your sucesss. They provided revelant design skills, insights, and mentorship, allowing me to learn about things that have helped me succeed as a professional today. Now I do reccommend that you consider the amount of time you want to put in here. What you put in as far as questions and extra practice is all up to you and will benefit you if you allow it to. They will give you the water but it is your decision to drink, so to speak. The course is broken up into different parts of the design process, for different weeks, and this allowed us to really deep dive into the specific designs skills that we needed.Professionally, the course also provided resume/portfolio advice, mock interviews, and branding guidance. They teach you skills as a designer but also prepare your brand to be competitive in this field. This is something that places Ironhack a notch ahead of other schools.Upon hiring week, yes they have a hiring week, I interviewed with 12 potential companies, gainining 3 job offers and accepting one offer for a well-paid consulting gig. Now, like I mentioned previously, you have to listen to what Daniel Brito, the hiring manager, says to a tee, he is an industry expert and will give you the best advice if you listen. You also have to put in the time during/after class to sharpen you skills and listen to the design instructors, they will not give you the job you have to honestly work for it.Overall the most important thing I learned from this course, besides the many design skills, was that you can accomplish anything if you truly put your mind to it. My class consisted of students from all types of backgrounds, biology, anthropology, I came from psychology and digital marketing. But we all gained enough valuable skills and contacts in the field to accomplish our goals, whatever that was to each individual.

I accepted this opportunity with pleasure, having done tutoring in the past, and as I found Ironhack to be a productive and fun environment.A few good points about the course, from a mixed perspective of a former student and a current team member:As a student, I found the Ironhack team to be personal, accessible and dedicated to its students. The general manager and all the other staff were always a room away, and ready to greet anyone with kindness and a positive change attitude. Having researched the market a bit, and consulting friends who are experienced developers, the curriculum learned in the course seems to be extremely relevant to the current ecosystem. As a team member, I notice the effort we make to constantly adjust the course as needed. This is a regular mission, as technologies change, trends come and go and the market shifts. However, beyond the specific technologies learned, the most important skill I gained during this bootcamp was the conceptual understanding of the process and architecture of a full-stack project. For instance, a strong focus was understanding what APIs are, how they are designed, and how they serve as a kind of language to interact with data.

The TA’s at Ironhack, Kevin and Ariel, are former graduates of the program. They are very knowledgeable and help support the students since they have been through the bootcamp experience themselves. Instead of just telling you how to solve whatever you may be having difficulty with, they help guide you to the solution so that you can really think like a programmer. If you are really stuck, both Kevin and Ariel do a great job of reinforcing key concepts.Daniel Brito, the placements manager is one of the most passionate people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting.

He constantly encourages you to have “no chill” and will work hard and fight for you so long as you put in the work.The most important things I gained from attending Ironhack are learning programming and knowing where to turn when I got stuck. Ironhack taught me the foundations of web development and skills that I can transfer as I learn new programming languages and grow as a developer. I was able to get a full time job as a developer a little over a week after graduation, and I can truly say Ironhack has helped me change my life!Now you might be reading this and asking yourself, so this sounds great, but what\'s the catch?.

(we were a little behind on our work, because of national holidays). This to me screams passion for your work. Also all the extra work that he put in like staying late to debug our errors and make sure our application is back up because it crashed the day before presentation day.... it is very much appreciated!Also the TA\'s Ariel and Kevin were great for extra support and guidance.

There\'s a nice grassy rooftop to relax outside when you\'ve been staring at a computer for hours. There\'s also a free keg and delicious snacks in the kitchen. Its also walking distance from the metro. Great spot.- **You do NOT have to be an expert in JS to take this course, but you MUST have a firm grasp on it. The course moves very very quickly and you can\'t be spending time re-hashing JS. The entire course basically builds upon JS so make sure you can code it comfortably.**- You\'re going to have to work on the weekends, otherwise you\'ll forget.- Try being a week ahead on assignments and doing them on your own. That way when it comes time to go over it in class you\'ve already digested it at least once and you\'re prepared to ask meaningful questions.- The journey doesn\'t end after Ironhack, you\'ll have to work even harder to retain everything you\'ve learned, apply it, and build on top of that knowledge. This bootcamp isn\'t a shortcut to a career, its a stepping stone.Bottom line? Great people, great course.

Having done several proyects at IH made my integration at the developer´s team very fast and within the first month I was on the same programming path as my companions.About the staff and professionals that works at IronHack i´ve got no complains as they were trustworthy and had the knowledge I seeked to fulfill my goals. I also had luck having great fellow students that were encouraging each other whenever one got stuck over difficult issues . If you are researching IH I think the best way is to ask one of the ex-alumni that are over internet, linkedin or even in person at the events. They would probably tell you that they dont regret the experience and solve many doubts you may have.Read Less','ironhack'),(944,236315,'Experience at Ironhack Madrid','2017-06-01',1,5,5,5,5,'Before attending Ironhack in Madrid, I worked in Miami for a company related to technological products and LED illumination, named Airis USA.

Well... after the bootcamp I can say that it was totally true and that it exceeded my expectations, mainly because I could not believe it would be so easy to find a job. It definitely was.It can be said that Ironhack is not just a matter of studying but also working hard and being involved in a Learn by Doing Community. You work hard developing projects during the bootcamp, alone and with your mates. It is not studying theory but learning from the best professionals sharing their experience and from every mistake you do.The Community issue is one of my favourites: when you learn and work with other people, as you help each other, you see everyone gets to different solutions starting at the same point. You realise that the team grows ten times faster than you would learn online or in other courses. And also we got involved in the professional community: that helped us a lot to find jobs after the Bootcamp. Everybody says College do not prepare people to work and you need to start in a job to really learn.

I had always been a gamer, tinkerer, and someone that could generally figure out electronics, but I found myself working a job I didn\'t really... Read More like, for pay that I knew was below me (sorry kitchen workers, it\'s below everyone).I began my journey by attending a local Pittsburgh school (where I resided previously), studying software development. After taking a host of prerequisite courses, I finally had one online coding class scheduled in after a semester full of speech, philosophy, and biology. Much to my dismay, it was outdated; generally not that well put together; and taught me no valuable skills related to the field, which I can now objectively say as I\'m in it.Fortunately, somewhere in that first semester of college, a family member told me about a radio show on NPR that mentioned coding bootcamps. As that second miserable semester and job-related stress began to grow, the idea seemed more and more like it should be a reality. I began looking into schools with none other than course report.At the time in Miami, Ironhack was brand new, although they were an established brand in Madrid &amp; Barcelona. There was another coding school in the area, but they lacked the international credentials and reviews from previous students that would allow me to feel comfortable in putting down a significant amount of money, move to another state, and restart my life. After the course, and being a part of the Miami tech scene, I can say that this was great intuition and am very happy with that decision.The PeopleIronhack from the start was unbelievably helpful. At the time, the team was very small, but I always had the opportunity to be in direct contact with the co-founder; Ariel.Ariel is an impressive co-founder and found a way to avoid the bad bits of Miami tech. At Ironhack, the people you will graduate with, be mentored by, and listen to as guest speakers are the top of the top. This is also reflected in the people he hires.Nizar, the head instructor, is a legend amongst Ironhackers and this isn\'t without warrant. He\'s an incredibly patient, talented teacher and developer. This is an incredibly rare combination. Often times in traditional schools (in my experience) you will encounter good coders who just don\'t have the ability to teach. This is why so many people think they can\'t code coming out of school. From interview to graduation, and beyond, Nizar is a rockstar.The Course The interview process was a bit nerve wracking, as most interviews are; but if you follow directions, put in the work to study, and really want to change your life you will succeed. You will be expected to learn a few coding topics relatively quickly, and then be tested on it.The course itself is more than likely unlike most academic experiences you\'ve taken part in.Often times in school, you\'ll be introduced to facts and then be expected to memorize them. Once these facts are memorized, you\'ll spit them back out onto a quiz, and some person in the ivory tower gives you a piece of paper that says you\'re smart. This mentality is busted in development, and Ironhack\'s curriculum reflects that. You will be introduced to topics, given examples and the opportunity to ask questions, and then it\'s off to the races. You will build something. This is the X factor that online platforms such as codeacademy, treehouse, and others are missing. This is what propels you to be a quality developer. Building Things.There are no easy A\'s. You\'re judged on what you build. That is life as a developer.My AdviceIf you aren\'t happy with the way things are, change it. Do your due dilligence, sift through reviews, and call each bootcamp.

While after university there is a huge gap between where you are and where you want to go, after Ironhack you actually have already contacts in where you want to go. In the bootcamp there will be events, people coming, lectures from interesting companies, but it will be up to you to network with them, nothing will come by itself. For example, after the hiring days 6 companies reached me and two weeks after I have offers for working for two of them. But it’s very up to you to have the initiative and search for the opportunities and also to decide which is a fair job deal. One month after I was hired in a big company with excellent wages and conditions, but still I feel it\'s rare. WHAT I LIKEDI went almost from zero in design. I had audiovisual background and it helped to improve some skills I  already had. But, I did build mostly everything from scratch. And now I feel like I increased 100% my skills. Immersive atmosphere it\'s all about design for 10 weeks. You will find yourself reading design articles while having breakfast and going to bed with design documentaries. Team feeling. You spent a lot of time with the same persons every day. You better deal with it, make the most for getting along with them and encourage them to make things together. You will end the bootcamp with a groups of friends extremely motivate with design. WHAT I MISSEDGoing deeper in some parts of the curricula. More connection with lecturer\'s job during their classes. You are very free to do the tasks as good as you want. I missed more guidance when you feel demotivated in other to get better results for the portfolio. Not just getting task done because there are a deadlines.Read Less','ironhack'),(952,236224,'Opinion Ironhack','2017-05-26',0,4,4,4,4,'Me llamo Enrike y soy antiguo alumno de Ironhack.

After our discussion, I talked with my family and we all agreed that Ironhack provided the best opportunity to my grow and achieve my aspirations.When I started the class, I was a bit nervous. Others seemed to be far ahead of me because of prior coding experience. To be frank, I was intimidated, I wanted to quit and didn\'t think I could ever catch up. After the first few days, Ironhacks true strengths started to reveal itself. Nizar, my instructor, and Josh, the teaching assistant, were extremely helpful. To be clear, they helped me think through a lot of the problems or guided me to resources. I appreciate this a lot because it developed my critical thinking skills and also pushed me to become a better programmer. Josh and Nizar were able to do this because of the intimate class size, and I felt they were truly passionate in myself and other classmates.I also felt that the entire staff at Ironhack was unbelievable and open to having discussions with me. Ariel, one of the co-founders, was always at the campus and made it his goal to know all the students. He was always available to talk and address any concerns I had, or drink a few beers with me and the other students after a long week.At the end of the course Ironhack did a great job of prepping us for work. While I did not end up taking a developer job, Ironhack set me up for success in two ways. The first, Ironhack taught me how to learn. There was no answer in the back of the book, there were resources like stack overflow that I had to use to figure out my bugs. I had to be resourceful, and truly think through problems to see if they made sense, this was a skill that Ironhack helped develop. Secondly, while I did not take a coding job, Ironhacks location in a co-working space worked great for me. I was offered an unbelievable opportunity by a tech company that worked out the same space two weeks before the completion of the program. I would have not had that opportunity come to me otherwise.Ironhack was amazing, and an extremely worthwhile investment for me.

Is it the right school for you? I was in your shoes and after graduation I can say 100% confident that going to Ironhack was one of the best decisions that I made in my life! The most important investment you can make is in yourself. Before IronHack I studied two years in University majoring in Computer Science and I dropped out. I was working regular jobs, but I always was interested in technology so I started learning how to code on my own. It\'s a great way to start but If you want make into a career It\'s much easier with a real mentor and help from professionals. Compared to my University IronHack teaching the latest trending technology like MEAN stack and that\'s exactly what employers are looking for. Learning process: your everyday routine will be starting with lectures and after more importantly - practice. You do some exercises in pairs and then individually. Lead instructor is Nizar - absolutely great teacher! He really knows what he is talking about and excellent with explaining, giving analogy examples to simplify things, and ready to help when you struggle. During lectures you can ask any question at any time. In class you will code along with instructor, there will be frequent stops where both Nizar and TA will make sure nobody is falling behind and everybody is on the same page. All staff is really friendly, cool and ready to help you. You can find yourself joking around with Ariel before you find out that he is actually co-founder. I liked project weeks the most, that\'s where you apply everything you learned and build your own application. You come up with an idea, design database structure and app architecture. I learned how to manage your project and your time (you have to meet deadline) along with public speaking skills (presenting your project). In reward: You will get portfolio with 3 projects that will easily separate you from University grads and show employers that you actually can build fully working apps.Your classmates will become your friends. You can find people with similar mindset and passion to create. Even having a full time job I am still working on side projects with people I met during IronHack. Also I moved in with two classmates, we extended our learning outside IronHack by helping each other after school and we became really great friends! Try to move in with somebody from your course, you will thank me later.What can I say about job searching? - Shortly, I had two job offers just in two weeks after graduation. They have a designated man that works full time to make sure you get hired - Daniel Brito (placement manager). He knows almost everybody in Miami tech ecosystem and will introduce you to those who are hiring. You are going to learn with him how to be a real job hunter and how to crush the interviews. He can give you some additional personal advises and will be helping you even after graduation.Sounds great right, but what\'s the catch? It\'s hard. If you are just looking for easy money that developers earn you are knocking at the wrong door. Course is intense and it\'s only begining, you will have to work hard to be successful. The most important skill that you need to learn is how to learn, how to be resourceful. On my job we use different tools than IronHack and you need to be ready for that.

My aim was to gain skills that would allow me to bootstrap a project more easily. And I can honestly say that IronHack surpassed all my expectations.Ironhack is nothing like your University experience. It’s a super-intense, hands-on experience that merges learning, doing, building and networking. A typical day would start with lectures in the morning, exercises in the afternoon, followed by a seminar by Alvaro on personal branding, back to exercises in the evening and finally beers to power through the early night. The teachers are always available and willing to help, and the class soon turns into a group of very close friends. As for the learning experience, unbound by the constraints of traditional universities, IronHack can morph its curriculum on the go to keep up with the latest demands of the market, giving you the tools to keep on learning beyond and after the course.Overall my experience at IronHack was very positive. I think of it as the perfect complement to an undergraduate degree in any field, opening the door to a world of new possibilities.

It wasn\'t an easy decision to invest all that money and that time. That\'s why I take the time to write an honest review of my experience. Reading student reviews helped me to take my decision, and I feel grateful to the people who took the time to write one. Besides, I heard that Ironhack is now launching in Paris and I really want to be a part of the french Ironhackers community :)Basically, I started the bootcamp with little knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript. In only two months, Ironhack turned me into a Junior FullStack Developper.When I started my new job a few weeks ago, I was able to deliver something , and that felt good. Ironhack taught how to learn what I don\'t know and how to collaborate with a team. That means that from the beginning, the level will be really demanding (even the best student in my cohort would agree with that!). Days are usually 10-12 hours long.In my case, we had a new teacher every week to teach us a module. They all have a deep knowledge of what they teach and a real understanding of the professionals needs (since all of them work as developers). So every morning you\'ll a have class with the teacher, and every afternoon you\'ll put it in practice with an individual exercise and pair programming. That\'s probably the key of that bootcamp, a huge amount of practice. The teacher assistants, the most patient, dedicated, nice and skilled people you\'ll ever meet (really, where do they find them?) will help you to accomplish what will often seem impossible.You\'ll code real projects.

In my case, I realized a project for a Madrid\'s Startup that is now a finalist in a local contest.At the end of the bootcamp, Ironhack team presented us to 20 companies from the local scene. Being able of showing real projects is certainly what made that many of us found a job then, and that Ironhack hiring rate is so high. In a broader scale, Ironhack\'s success comes certainly from its high sense of community (you\'ll quickly learn about the Ironbeers;). I mean that in my bootcamp I had a great time with the other students and we still party together. In that matter, Ironhack definitely has spanish DNA. But it\'s more than that.

At that event, I met a guy who was also at the course trying to build his site. I told him my interest in Wyncode and the developer role where he immediately told me that if I was going to pay for a school, it should be Ironhack. That was when I learned, that Ironhack is one of those schools that could have their doors packed with people &amp; students if they really wanted to. But they don\'t! They have a selective acceptance process where they try to weed out those that want to \'code\' and those that have a passion for technology + code. It didn\'t occur to me at first but, that had been the single most luckiest and best decision I had ever made, choosing Ironhack. And I can say that, why? Because I experienced both. Not only did I go to the Learn To Code In A Day but my brother, who also wanted to develop, took the web-dev course, but at Wyncode. So here\'s my perspective on both, no strings attached. Ironhack\'s taught me how to be more comfortable with computers, code, and manage software and its architecture. It gave me a chance to really sit down with technology and learn the in\'s and outs, talk the talk but also walk the walk...Of course, every web-dev program will (hopefully) do that. The caveat is the people. The people here at Ironhack are phenomenal. From the lead instructor Nizar, to the wonderful ladies who tidy up the place when they need to; it was all wonderful. At first, my biggest fear was having this program be more oriented around business than the actual \'learning\' part of everything. Kind of something like where you walk in, they teach you for 9 weeks and thats it, just a good luck! goodbye! That fear was immediately laid to rest when I met the team. If we are talking just culture, not even considering quality of the education, Ironhack has it down pat. These people truly care for you, and your future, as if your fate was their own. I have seen many of them go beyond their \'work\' requirements to help a student in need; whether that be staying late to clear up some confusions for students or at times carpooling to a networking event. The Ironhack team is a team of focused, determined, and compassionate individuals who will get you to where you want to be, in your career. Now, lets talk about the education. Nizar is the lead instructor here, and was the main instructor in my course. The man is brilliant. Extremely patient with students, gives you room to fail and make your own mistakes when you need to but also catches you when you\'re going to fall too deep. The course itself is really well built, you pretty much have a couple hours of lecture everyday where they introduce you to the new material, followed by a pair-programming exercise and a do-alone exercise. We were also the first cohort where they introduced two other main projects to, whereas before you only had one final project that you had to present and demo for your graduation. This was one aspect that I feel Ironhack really excelled in. These first two projects really taught me a lot, not only about the actual code but also things like time management, soft skills and working with others, asking for help, etc that a lot of other courses didn\'t get to fully experience. Nizar does a phenomenal job taking care of his staff + students, and the quality of education really reflects that.Now, what about finding a job? They have a placement manager here, Brito, who\'s job is to connect you to companies who are looking to hire developers, and kind of get the ball rolling... Daniel Brito is one of Ironhack\'s greatest commodities, because he knows everyone in Miami and will go to extreme lengths to putting you in touch with the right person/company.This guy could sell water to a ski-boat if he wanted to. He pushes you to be just like him, a go-getter. He willl call you non-stop to make sure you sent the right email, he will chase you down to make sure you applied for the right company and he will give you the necessary butt whooping if needed. The guy has experience, has been in the tech business for some time, and is super well connected and has those relationships that are really necessary when looking for employment in the tech-industry. Plus, he\'s funny as hell. In the end, my brother needed to go back and re-learn a bunch of the material after his graduation. Till today, he calls me and asks for help and an extra pair of eyes for his code. And we took two different courses, almost simultaneously. All in all, Ironhack has a top of the line team with top of the line skills, and anyone who walks into the building can tell the second they walk in. It has changed my life and the way I look at it, completely. I will forever be in-debted to some of the people here that were so patient and took their time with me.

I never thought that in 8 weeks I would fully develop a new skill, and learn multiple new programming languages and be able to single handedly create a full functioning web application. This is something that made me a more desirable candidate in conjunction with my data analytics and system engineering background. The journey only begun there, however. The staff at Ironhack has somehow figured out a way to make each and every student feel as though they are the number one priority. Whether it was one-on-ones throughout the course to just check on your status and how you’re feeling, all the way to standing strong with me when I was ready to give up multiple times in finding the correct job for me. Daniel Brito specifically refused to let me give in to my doubts on finding the job culture fit for me. Although Ironhack was amazing with placing students in positions, I wanted THE position – the ultimate job, and I refused to settle on anything less than that. I have never met anyone who has more connections in a city than Brito, and it was almost humorous to me how almost every job I interviewed for, someone knew him and always in a positive light, which only made me have more faith. Ultimately when I began restructuring my job search, it was single handedly the fact that my resume was in the hands of the right people at the right places that I was able to get the opportunities that I did. And, I would not have had that advantage if I didn’t do Ironhack and have Daniel Brito as a career coach. Having finally started the next steps in my career at a well known fashion e-commerce company, I finally feel that I am in the environment right for me with the co-workers who can help me in growing with the company and excel in my role. And as it turns out, I got the interview since my boss had my resume on file from one of his best friends, Daniel Brito, and the with the right knowledge base and personality, I was able to secure the position. I could not have asked for a better job placement experience, and I can say that I legitimately owe it to Ironhack.Read Less','ironhack'),(983,244708,'I\'ll do it over if i could','2017-03-29',1,5,5,5,5,'I was a part of the first cohort for UX/UI Design in Miami.

Though a lot of the work and change has to come from oneself.The first instructor to get us going was Jacqueline and the best person for the job to introduce us to user research. She was a force of positivity and encouragement in the class. I really appreciated that. Joel another instructor had such a way of keeping one curious kept me always wanting more. Mr. Marcelo the instructor who came in after Jacqueline an amazing designer. All his vast amount of knowledge was golden. Josh our final instructor for the Front-end proportion of the course probably with highest difficulty part of the class but, still he helped us make it through, made it enjoyable, and fascinating overall. The classroom environment is really open and if one feels like they won\'t be able on the level with everyone else that shouldn\'t be a concern. All the students come from different backgrounds in a way that really adds to the experience overall and benefits all the students. The course is designed in a way to be accessible to all, but it is a large amount of information to squeeze into a small time frame. There were times throughout the course I felt one week feels like two weeks in one. It\'s partly due to the amount of information one absorbed in a small amount of time. One really has to be fully committed to doing this. Overall the people in the class helps one stay motivated and encourages everyone to really push oneself and keep going. The person to oversee everything in our class was Alida she made sure the class and everyone was on track all the way to career week. The preparation to career week can be a stressful time but the person to help you through it is Daniel Brito he is your cheerleader, advisor, mentor, best friend, and sensei all in one.

One shouldn\'t expect to master everything at their time at Ironhack it\'s all a process and like I mentioned it before a lot of the change has to come from oneself.Overall Ironhack really has opened the door to the tech community for me.

Before starting classes, we had a week of pre-work to get started with the basics of design. My class was a small class (8 students) so we received very personalized attention. My classmates came from very different backgrounds and we all had different strengths which was nice. We had two amazing instructors (Jackie and Marcelo) that each have over 15+ of experience. During the bootcamp, we had lectures during the morning and hands on practice during the evenings, which in my opinion is a great way of learning. I think the curriculum was very thorough. And also it is nice that every other week you have a one-on-one meeting with the staff to make sure you are doing OK. Alida, the operations manager,was there with us to make sure everything ran smoothly. Wednesdays were my favorite day, because we had guest speakers who had years of experience in UX Design. Through the bootcamp, I was able to make great connections and to meet a lot of people involved in the tech and startup community. We had one week of front-end development (more specifically HTML5 and CSS3) which I wish we had more! Josh was an amazing instructor. We had a career week, which was a great experience.

A month or so after telling myself it just wasn\'t meant to be, I received news that Ironhack was introducing a six month part-time course for the first time ever. I proceeded to look at the time commitment involved. Tuesday and Thursday nights and half of my Saturday for six months? I could totally swing that. Again, the money wasn’t an insignificant issue, but how many more times would I be telling myself “Maybe next time”? How much longer could I go about seeing the developers at work go about their ways and find myself regretting not having pursued this endeavor years ago? How would I feel seeing the students in the program presenting their projects six months from now and knowing I could have been a part of it?I submitted my application and was contacted by Alia, Ironhack Miami’s awesome Marketing &amp; Community Manager, to schedule an interview. We spoke that same day, where I told her my reasons for applying for the program and how it would help me grow as a professional and as a person. To potential applicants, think of it less as an interview and more as a conversation.After that, I scheduled my time for the second stage of the application process, the technical interview. Alia sent me an email with links to the material I would have to study, and when I wasn’t at work, I had my head down focusing on absorbing as much of the content as possible. When the day of the interview came, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t incredibly nervous about what task I would be assigned.Nizar quickly proved that all of my fears were for naught. He walked me through the steps required to complete the task and offered to help if at any time I became confused, frustrated, or just hopelessly lost. Luckily, it didn’t come to that due to the thoroughness of the study materials, but it says a lot about the quality of a program when its instructors understand how intimidating this part of the process can be. I won’t describe the nature of the practical interview for the sake of keeping it fair for future applicants, but trust me when I say that the Ironhack team will give you all the preparation you’ll need.I received my acceptance email the next morning and immediately paid my deposit so I knew it was real. A few days later, I received access to the platform I’d be using to complete the pre-work and some information on Day 0, the unofficial first day of the program.The pre-work was challenging but presented at a pace that helped facilitate learning of the early fundamental concepts. This allowed me to walk into the class the first day and follow along with the coursework we were presented with. The teaching sytle was incredibly hands on, a combination of lectures and practical exercise to solidify what we\'d learned that day. The instructor and TAs were always available to answer any questions in a matter that further helped facilitate learning - instead of providing a direct answer, they would ask questions themselves and guide you to think of an appropriate solution. The learning platform was available 24/7 with all of the lectures and exercises covered in class to help get as much practice as necessary. The course did reach a level of difficulty that had me wondering at times whether I was meant to pursue this path, but the Ironhack staff consistently encouraged us to keep pushing forward one day at a time, all the way until it came time to work on our final project. That\'s where all of the topics we\'d covered over the past few months accumulated into one concentrated effort - we were able to achieve things we\'d never before imagined possible with code, bolstered by the support of the instructors, the mentors we were provided with, and each other. It was at this point that I also realized how strong of a bond I had made with my fellow classmates - we were always willing to help one another with any tricky issues that would come up and celebrated each other\'s success. The Hack Show served as a celebration of all the work we\'d put in, where we each showed the collective product of our effort to a huge audience made up of friends, family, and members of the Miami tech community. I actually ended up winning the show with my project which was a huge surprise and sense of joy, but the overall purpose of the evening is to be proud of what we\'ve done, not to chase a prize. The connections made throughout the program are nothing short of phenomenal. Daniel Brito is a veritable juggernaut at getting students to push themselves as hard as possible and matching them with phenomenal web development job opportunities. We were also connected to hundreds of other members of the tech community through various Slack channels we were invited to, only helping to further foster the sense of belonging. We entered the program as outsiders and left as essential parts of the Miami tech community as a whole.

However, my situation was a little different as working at this company had been my dream.So, here I was on January 2016 looking for a “new dream”, one that could not be torn apart so easily and big enough to keep me motivated. I wanted to take this setback in my professional career and turn it into an opportunity to grow. I have always enjoyed solving problems as well as trying to understand how the technologies that have marked our lives nowadays work. It was at this moment that I realized that I could make an interesting mix with these two ingredients by learning how to code.I started looking online for possible ways to get into coding and that’s how I found out about Ironhack. I read excellent reviews about their programs, instructors, staff members and facilities, which motivated me to visit their campus in Miami. I was welcomed by Alia (Admissions), who kindly explained me everything about their coding school. At some point, after being amazed by her charisma, I even thought that Ironhack was too good to be true — Was it possible to learn how to code and launch a web application after only 8 weeks? Were their graduates really landing cool jobs with competitive salaries in the tech industry? I honestly was skeptic about it.That day I also met Ariel (Co-Founder), who shared with me his vision and explained how he, coming from a family of educators, wanted to change the world of education. It was something that I had never heard before.My visit continued with a tour around the facility and then I spent a few minutes talking to some of the students. It caught my attention that there were many students from different backgrounds and even different countries, including India! Why would someone from the other side of the world come to Ironhack to learn how to code? Maybe the reviews were true, maybe they knew what they were doing.And that’s when something inside me said that I should give this a try. I was already aware that as part of the admission process first I needed to do a general interview and then a technical interview. Of course, I spoke with Alia for more than an hour, enough to come to the conclusion that my personality was “ideal to handle the intensity of the bootcamp”. That only left me with the technical interview before I could be considered for a seat in the March 2016 cohort. We scheduled my technical interview with Nizar (Head Instructor) for the following week and then I left Ironhack with the feeling that I had done the right thing.Alia had sent me an e-mail with the material that was going to be covered during my technical interview. During that week, I spent at least 6 hours a day going over the JavaScript concepts and exercises. I must say that this was the first moment that I felt overwhelmed about programming. There were some concepts hard to understand and some exercises that I didn’t even know how to initially approach. And then the day of my technical interview finally came and I felt that I wasn’t ready. I was parked outside the school, debating if I should really do it or not — “What if I suck?”, “I don’t want to embarrass myself”, “Maybe I should just go home” — Unbelievable, what was I thinking and since when I was so weak? I was about to give up on this without even trying. No, no, no, I took a deep breath and walked in to finish what I had started.Nizar, who by the way is very fluent in English and Spanish, explained me the format of the technical interview: I had to solve a coding challenge with 5 iterations and I was allowed to use my notes, but there was a time cap (I don’t remember if it was 15 or 30 minutes). While I was working on the challenge, I realized that I knew more than what I thought. I was able to finish the first 4 iterations before I ran out of time. Yes, it was challenging, but it wasn’t that bad. Nizar reviewed my solution and gave me good feedback. I could felt right away that he had the vocation of teaching.A few days later, I got an e-mail from Ironhack, where they said that they had reviewed my application and decided to accept me for their next cohort. Wooohooo!!! That was a small victory after being so close of simply rejecting this opportunity. Once accepted, I paid the tuition, got access to their online student platform and was sent the pre-work material. The pre-work is a module composed of four parts that covers the basics of Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As expected, in many occasions I found myself stuck with some of the exercises, but Ironhack was always available to do Google hangouts to go over my questions. This is when I met Josh (Teaching Assistant), who I knew was part of the first cohort in Miami and was now teaching others how to code. Josh, like Nizar, showed me his commitment as an educator.I finished the pre-work during Week 0 and then we kicked off the bootcamp with Week 1. I truly loved the layout of the program and most importantly I always felt that I was surrounded by great and smart people, always willing to help me and with such an incredible amount of patience, including my classmates. Learning how to code is not easy, but when you are in an environment like this one, it makes the process very enjoyable.By Week 2, we weren’t a group of strangers anymore, we were more like a family immersed in this new cool world. When we were not coding, we were talking about coding and in some cases listening even more about coding from other experts as every week Ironhack brought in speakers (senior developers, CTOs and CEOs) to give us insightful information about the tech scene in Miami.Our regular schedule was from 9 am to 6 pm, but I don’t remember spending less than 10 hours at Ironhack every day. I didn’t know I was going to love coding this much. At the beginning, I was skeptic about what Ironhack was capable of doing, and now I was experimenting it. In 8 weeks, I learned how to code and I also built my first web application, but most importantly, I learned how to learn. Being a developer means that you will never stop learning and Ironhack gave me the tools to keep doing this on my own.We concluded our cohort with a Hackshow, where everyone presented their web applications in front of 180+ people. This was a great way to celebrate our efforts and achievements, and a perfect opportunity to network as in a few days we were going to be in the job market as Jr. Developers.And when it comes to job market, Ironhack has another killer player: Daniel Brito (Placements Manager), who is not Romero Britto’s cousin but still does cool things. Daniel helped us with our resumes and online presence, he prepared us for our future interviews and introduced us to many employers. Some of my classmates got job offers right away, and some others, like me, took a little longer. Daniel always kept me accountable and motivated to never give up. His phone was available 24/7, I called him several times late at night and even weekends looking for feedback and he always picked up the phone. You can surely tell that he loves his job, which is helping others in their quest of success.I now have a job where I use technology to solve problems, where I’m constantly learning, and which has allowed me to improve my quality of life.Ironhack is not only a bootcamp, it’s a life-changing experience and a family that will always be there for you.

Read More as an entrepreneur with a small non-tech startup company which focus on customer experience and product development. When I like something, I’ll be the best ambassador of that product or service, but when I’m not happy, I’m always very honest about my reviews. This is part of my own personal opinion of my whole bootcamp experience. Something that I wish someone would have told me before joining the bootcamp.Before deciding to attend to IronHack, I have had several interviews for a few coding schools in the United States that were 12-weeks courses. Unfortunately, I didn’t get enough funds to attend to the one I really wanted. Then I found about IronHack in Barcelona that was a 8-week course and which the city’s living costs were also more affordable. Also all the reviews were almost 5 stars, so I decided to apply and prepare for the journey.I did a lot of online tutorials and practices few simple coding challenges because the previous schools that I applied to demanded to have basic programming knowledge. I was very surprised that the interview process was very easy, maybe is because the main focus of the school is to take students from 0% to 80%. I had the chance that a friend that attended another bootcamp had shared with me his experience of his pre-work of the other school. So I was kind of surprised how disorganized and how poorly made the pre-course work was. We were not even ask how we were doing with it at the time.I wrote my own very personal review, but since one of my classmates have better english writing skills and I couldn’t agree more on what the author wrote, which its content is similar the two pages I wrote, I asked for permission for posting and editing the review. I’ll just highlight a few other personal comments starting with to slashes ( // ) at the end of each paragraph of the author’s review.We were supposed to be sent a overall bootcamp feedback survey, but even before that they were already asking us for positive feedback. My classmate’s review post and my personal add-ons:“ … Still, there has yet to be any surveys sent out, yet each week we had to complete two surveys on the quality of our instructors. This speaks volumes to the quality and goals of Ironhack. Additionally, we were told that there would be extensive career help, even a spreadsheet for us to fill out in order for Ironhack to track our progress, yet, this request for a review was sent out before even a slight mention of such a spreadsheet. There’s been no career follow up, no LinkedIn or resume reviews and I am extremely disappointed, to say the least.// Before attending the bootcamp, IronHack sent me a PDF of more than 5 slides with “career support” that was supposed to taught during the whole duration of the bootcamp.I’m an entrepreneur, and one of the things that completly appreciated about this bootcamp is that it was meant for entrepreneurs, as their Twitter profile says, note that not a single lecture involved any entrepreneurial concept with code.My experience at Ironhack was amazing in regards to my peers and the quality of our TAs. Despite there being only one TA per 8 students, they went above and beyond to help us out and it was so appreciated. // Thanks to the TAs for all their effort!Aside from that, I entirely regret choosing Ironhack for my bootcamp experience as Ironhack has failed at their only two objectives: be a great educator and be a great business. My list of possible improvements is endless, but here are a few:  1 Start by actually vetting your instructors. Have them do a test run in front of you. Are they comfortable with public speaking? Do they engage the audience? Are they clear when speaking English? Are their materials written in proper English? Are the passionate about working with others? If you don’t know the answers to these questions, you shouldn’t be hiring the instructor. If you wouldn’t want to listen to them on a Monday morning, don’t hire them. Period. // There were days that I honestly think I’d learned more in CodeSchool, that the current lecture because some of the teachers didn’t seem to be prepared or didn’t have high teaching skills. 2 Be upfront about the condition of the work space and classroom. Ironhack should be ashamed of the condition of our classroom in Barcelona. I was ashamed when posting class pictures because the room looked so horrible and rundown, and it was. Paint chipping, the room hadn’t been swept or dusted in forever, there were maybe only three quality chairs in the entire room (how are developers supposed to code for over 10 hours a day on plastic chairs?), the room was unbearably hot and we had to pretty much protest for weeks in order to get fans which then just circulated all of the dust around the room. The projector didn’t even have a screen and it was close to impossible to follow along with the instructors having to adjust their settings so frequently. The tables were not actually tables, but rather pieces of lumber stacked on wooden posts even though the average Mac in the classroom was worth $1500. If one of those Macs were to fall and break, I think we can both say that Ironhack was not going to cover the costs.  // The first thing I’d learn while studying at industrial engineering: work conditions (weather, ergonomics, etc) affects productivity. I truly understand and appreciate that Barcelona is such a environmentally friendly city, but take into account that 80% of our bootcamp was not form Barcelona, and I’m from Panama City, Panama (Central America), where is 30ºC all year round, and I haven’t been that suffocated by heat in a workspace in my entire life. 6 tables, 2 fans, not enough! By day 2 there where two more, and that wasn’t even enough. I literally had to bring my personal fan until the last day of the bootcamp because I couldn’t focus on class or during my final project. Some electric extension were laying on the floor, where easily more than 10 times people have tripped because of them. Also, as programmers that were supposed to spend 10hrs+ a day in that room, I expected to at least have basics: water and coffee. Filtered water tanks or water dispensers with filters, specially when not even people from Barcelona drink their own tap water because it is awful!  3 Reevaluate which students are accepted into the program. While of course more students mean more money, if you don’t have enough TAs and are unwilling to provide more, then simply get more selective and accept fewer students. Also, students who have been working as a developer and beginners are not to be in the same class. Reevaluate your mission as a school and choose an audience. The majority of the time, it felt as if the instructors were speaking to 3 of the 16 students. // Either you take people from 0% to 80%, or from 20% to 120%. There where students that haven’t even finished the pre-work before coming to class, and were accepted to start anyway. A lot of them were so lost on the basic concepts. I think it may have downgraded the class for people with more experience.  4 Establish your worth as a school and stick to it. Although each student paid the same amount, certain students have been afforded the opportunity to retake the bootcamp. If that is the case, are the rest of the students going to get half of their money back? I didn’t think so. I, in no way, learned as much as I thought I would have and I know I would have been given more attention had I chosen one of the American bootcamps, yet a second round at Ironhack was never offered to me. Keep it fair, it’s as a simple as that. // The fact that there were several students that either dropped out or very lost in class and they just decided to skip some subjects and do what they could, should have never happened on the first place if the pre-work was better built and proper follow-up student/pre-work would have existed. 5 While MOB is clearly not the correct choice to host Ironhack, at the bare minimum, if it is known that there is going to be loudly obnoxious construction the FINAL DAY OF PRESENTATIONS, the day for which we prepare during the entire bootcamp, the day that Ironhack invites guests to listen to its student’s present, you find an alternative space in Barcelona to host the presentations. It’s not that hard, not to mention Ironhack’s connections to startups with amazing presentation spaces. I’m sure those startups would have loved the exposure and would have loved to be a part of the presentations. Get creative, don’t get lazy. // At the HackShow, there where 40-50 people in that room, and I felt ashamed that the audience had to uncomfortable watch our presentations which such heat. Also, as a finalist for the top projects, I was very sad that not a single video was taken by IronHack, like the previous cohorts, or even t-shirts with our handles where given to all the students, to have memories about our experience presenting our final project. This may not sound very important, but if you start adding features, even as almost meaningless like the previously mentioned, you shouldn’t downgrade by taking it away. *MOB: Makers Of Barcelona, where the bootcamp was being held.* 6 Know your audience. During our “hiring help days”, the first thing that Alvaro said was that most of us probably aren’t comfortable with networking and approaching strangers. False. The majority of my class came from backgrounds like communications, media, marketing, sports, recruiting, journalism, customer service, etc. Learn about your students before you attempt to advise them. Additionally, don’t have us go into a corner and show you our LinkedIn profiles while you tear them apart — it’s not thorough and it’s inefficient. Take the time to look at the profiles in advance, take some notes and then discuss with us. It will save both your time and the student’s. // I like people being realistic, but Alvaro saying that it was almost impossible to get a job in Spain as a non european, was absolutely demotivational. Nevertheless, one of my classmates and me, non europeans, got job offers, because we manage to find alternatives to pursue success. So, don’t just say it’s almost impossible without providing work arounds. Also, how come you claim to have a 97% rate of hired students when not even 50% of the students are showing up at interviews and with such non-existing follow-up after that? 7 Hire more TAs. Don’t be greedy. Money is great, but a stronger reputation is worth much more and ensures longevity. Having to sit and wait 40 minutes to ask a question is beneficial for no one, especially a newbie.// I get that some students may have slow pace while learning, but the other students that are paying the same amount of money, deserve the same kind of attention and assistance during class. If you don’t want to let anyone behind, make sure that each student is really prepared to start a coding bootcamp. 8 Lastly, hire someone that has both customer service and teaching experience to facilitate the education aspects of Ironhack. You need them. As a former educator, most of the things that went wrong were simply due to lack of planning and experience. Even our welcome meeting was lackluster and could have been full of creative and light-hearted icebreakers designed to get everyone introduced to one another. // TAs had enough work as being TAs, someone that takes care of the customer experience and product is very needed so we don’t end out writing this long reviews!!!I truly hope you view this feedback as constructive more than anything. Everyone wants to see Ironhack succeed, but without some adjustments it’s truly not worth it. “// Couldn’t agree more with this!

They also set up a weekly meeting where students can provide feedback and share their thoughts. People there were real.Lastly, Ironhack provided great job assistance. Of course, I had to do 99% of the work following their strategic advice, but they set up interviews with companies (I received a job offer from one of them), provided useful resources and followed up with me on the phone almost weekly for practical advice and encouragement. As a result, I received a few job offers and am currently working for a growing tech company (where my colleagues know the Ironhack lead instructor).Ironhack really changed my life. There are many schools out there with different emphasis but I think the value of going to a coding school is to build skills, confidence and knowledge to continuously learn new technologies. Like myself, many coding school students will probably end up learning something new or maybe unrelated to what they have learned at school. Then, my recommendation is to go to a place like Ironhack where you interact with good people in a good environment where your learning experience will be joyful.Read Less','ironhack'),(1036,232297,'Great Stuff!','2015-04-12',0,4.3,5,4,4,'Ironhack was a valuable experience.

I learned a great deal about myself, made friends with wonderful people from all walks of life, and came out with a solid understanding of the web development landscape. I decided to join Ironhack... Read More because I wanted to learn more about web programming and gain a new skill. My job as a consultant consisted of working, communicating, and at times leading developers so I thought getting a leg up in coding would be beneficial in my day to day activities at work. I knew I needed to become code literate and that the best way for me to really learn programming would be to attend a course, to throw myself into the deep end. Into the deep end I went. My experience wasn’t all butterflies and rainbows. It was probably one of the toughest experiences of my life. There is a ton of content and it is constantly changing. It is a very rigorous curriculum with an aggressive timeline designed to really challenge you. It put my ego to the test, it made me feel dumb at times, and frustrated in others. The first week and a half I felt like I had been knocked down, but this was done intentionally, which I appreciated after the fact. It got me into gear and forced me to adopt a “can do” attitude. From a personal development standpoint the program helped me learn how to better overcome difficult situations, how to ask for help, and to really understand how detrimental negative self-talk can be to ones progress. From a technical development standpoint I was amazed at how much I learned and how much I was able to accomplish. I think what really differentiates Ironhack from other schools is their amazing team and their culture of “ the customer is always right”. I really loved and was really impressed by the constant feedback loop they incorporated into their system. It felt like a very intimate experience because they cared about my concerns, my thoughts, and most importantly my progress. They wanted to make sure I was getting everything I was expecting out of the program; an attitude that was adopted by all of the faculty and staff. Overall the instructors were superb. They were experts in their field, good instructors, and always extremely helpful and very respectful.Read Less','ironhack'),(1038,232065,'One of my best decisions','2015-02-01',1,5,5,5,5,'IronHack has been one of the most incredible experiences I’ve lived.The professors were very good in their fields, always attentive and very close, although some of them never taught before.

The selection process was very good because all of them were very motivated, hard-workers, fast-learners and close people.

I enjoyed living there immensely, was able to meet a lot of locals, and lots of great people in general. It\'s also relatively inexpensive and very walkable.Staff: People are really friendly, and... Read More I want them to succeedInstructors: About half of our instructors were great to fantastic and we learned a ton during their weeks.Class size: We had just 10 people in my cohort and we really felt like a family by the end.Atmosphere: It\'s very laid back, and a comfortable and safe feeling space.Network: They have a good Barcelona network, which is great if you want to live there and have an EU visa.Job assistance for EU citizens: They have a strong network in Barcelona and can get you interviews. Instructors and speakers will also be looking out for you and helping make connections. However, once my colleagues who are EU-citizens left Barcelona they found that assistance dropped off like a cliff and there was minimal communication. I learned a ton.Cons:Staff: Despite their friendliness, communication was a huge issue. Even before class started, I missed most of the Hangouts because I didn\'t realize the times were being posted to Slack. Emails were not returned in a timely manner before, during, and after my session. People were defensive when offered feedback. I was often told So and so will contact you about your concern. and then silence.Instructors: Two of our instructors were awful and it felt like they just wasted a week of our time which is a big deal when you are only studying for 6 weeks. We basically had to relearn everything we learned from our first JS teacher. They made up for the bad CSS class by bringing in a great instructor later on, but it meant we lost a day of working on our final project. Curriculum: It was frequently commented by my colleagues that it felt like we were being experimented on too much and I agree with them. We alternated between JS and Ruby instruction and the context switching was very confusing. They started us off the bat with Ruby and OO which was completely overwhelming for most people our first week. Visa sponsorship for non-EU: You will probably not be able to find someone to sponsor you for a visa. I wanted to stay and it seemed like it should be doable (I was one of the strongest students in the cohort), but even though there was some interest ultimately what I heard was it\'s way too hard to sponsor and very few companies are willing to do it. You are limited to large foreign companies and even then it can take 3 months.Job Assistance: Good or bad depending on your needs. I\'m going to move this out of the bullet, so read on below.We lost internet for a few days and last a ton of class time as a result. They didn\'t have a contingency plan so we had already lost almost two days before they found us a temp new space. Internet was pretty consistently bad the whole time we were there.Job Assistance:They were great while I was still in Barcelona, but as soon as I returned back to the states they went silent. I had previously decided with the cofounder that we would work on Barcelona until I left and then switch to SF. After two weeks of silence (I pinged a couple people during that time), I sent another email and this time they apologized and said it was a new guy\'s responsibility.I scheduled a Skype call with the new guy and I thought maybe things would improve. Well, he sent me a list of sites with job postings. And then the next week he sent me another email with one more site with a job posting. In the meantime I was adding the jobs I applied to on to a spreadsheet so they could see my progress.I did know that they would have less of a network in the states, but the cofounders are well connected. So I knew that it would take more effort on my part. However, job placement is absolutely crucial for any startup bootcamp, and Ironhack is expanding in to Miami. To succeed in the more competitive bootcamp market in the US, you need to cultivate relationships with companies that are specifically interested and willing to hire bootcamp students.My expectation was that they would reach out to companies and pitch Ironhack and their students– in other words be proactive. What actually happened was they checked my spreadsheet and if they knew someone there they put me in contact. Which is helpful and I don\'t want to discount that, except 2/3 of those contacts were for companies were I had already gotten myself an employee referral and since their contact wasn\'t in a position to hire me they couldn\'t really provide me any assistance. In my opinion this just isn\'t aggressive enough because if they can\'t hit a high placement % then they are doing good enough.Ironhack\'s response is that they are working hard and this is what they told me I\'d get, so if this meets your expectations you wil be fine. If not job placement is really important to you, you may want to look elsewhere.Tl;dr: Can be good depending on your needs. They can help you get jobs in Barcelona if you are eligible to work there, but if you want a lot of help for a non-EU job search they are limited to providing contacts to companies you\'ve applied to. So far from my cohort the only person placed through Ironhack was hired by Ironhack.Summary:It was a fun experience overall, and I don\'t regret it. I did learn a lot despite the hiccups. However, I can\'t help but feel like they could have done much better and the communication was consistently a huge issue. I felt frustrated by the time wasted because of bad or unprepared instructors and bad internet. I felt like they missed a lot of important topics such as code reviewing and interview prep. And job assistance didn\'t meet my expectations at all. So yeah, YMMV. Living in Barcelona though, that I can recommend with no hesitation.Read Less','ironhack'),(1040,231877,'Great Learning Experience in a Beautiful Place','2014-11-13',0,5,5,5,5,'I\'m an American who attended the September 2014 Web Development cohort in Barcelona.

Read More the most out of my experience. I decided to go for a longer bootcamp which would encompass more material and chose the 24 week program at App Academy. The hours are long and you really need to learn how to learn again. There was a big adjustment and there is the added pressure of not just learning new material but being able to solve problems based on what you learned on Monday for an assessment. If you do not score an 80% you will be deferred back a month. That was a lot of added stress on myself and classmates I would talk to. The staff for the most part is pretty friendly and helpful and want to help you succeed. One thing to note is that when you finish the course and move into the career hunt phase, you can still receive strikes for not completing things. If you do strike out during the career hunt you lose all access to the material that you paid for on the site which I do not agree with. Overall the curriculum is fast pace and constantly evolving.

App Academy uses a deferral system to measure mastery of material. That is, almost every Monday you are assessed on the previous week\'s material and need an 80% to pass. If you... Read More cannot pass, you are deferred into the cohort that started a month after you; ideally so you have time to review the material up to that point, and so you redo the week where you could not pass the assessment. While I was never deferred it is common for folks to defer, and it is common for folks to consistently barely survive each assessment. If you are prone to crack under pressure, these assessments can be intimidating; but App Academy gives you more than enough practice and resources over the weekend to ace every assessment. At times the projects used to teach the curriculum have frustrating or vague instructions. The canned response is that you as a developer have to be able to figure things out on your own, which while true to some degree feels like an excuse for the student:faculty ratio that\'s been affected by the boom in class size due to COVID and the course\'s popularity. Where you are really getting your money\'s worth is in the Job Search support. The post-grad system becomes your accountability partner, and the networking opportunity is great. Ultimately though, you are the one that has to take initiative and reach out. Overall, if I had to do this all over again, I would join an accelerated bootcamp that has a more rigorous technical assessment.

It is not for everyone, some find the steep learning curve too hard but if you are committed and you put in the necessary time, it is very doable and worthwhile.

If you work diligently and truly take advantage of the resources a/A provides for you, you really can change/advance your career. Here are some of my overall pros and cons for the program: Pros: - Even remote (due to COVID), help was easily accessible from our TA\'s through most of the process, and our cohort was so supportive of one another. - While the assessments can be daunting and can determine your fate in the course, the TA\'s hold office hours leading up to them that are extremely helpful and, I think, important for your success. - Paired programming forces you to learn how to communicate your code and thought processes to others (a skill that is so important in interviews and of course in the field). - You will graduate with 3 major projects that demonstrate your skills. a/A understands that you want them to be your best and although there are deadlines, you will be able to continue working on them before you are required to start looking for jobs. Cons: - I did feel that the HTML/CSS curriculum is not taught in lectures enough. It is mostly in self-taught lessons. Without a firm understanding of this material, starting/styling your major projects can be really overwhelming. - The daily projects that you and your partner do are structured to be very difficult and time consuming (you will likely never finish everything). Depending on your pace and understanding, you may not make it far enough to receive the practical experience on everything that was taught that day. - Many of the people who are part of the job search curriculum are really great at what they do, but it is truly on you to be proactive and take advantage of everything they have to offer, or you may feel very much on your own.Read Less','app-academy'),(1072,274708,'Awesome','2021-03-13',1,5,5,5,4,'I really felt App Academy was a great experience with instructors who really take their time to make sure you\'re learning the material.

Read More my experience was can hopefully give you some sense on how you will be able to handle a bootcamp. (For the record, App Academy is amazing, the teachers are awesome, the documentation is \'mostly\' great, and I tripled my salary after a month of job seeking) Prior to joining App Academy, I was about a year out of college and was working as a software engineer recruiter. In college I graduated with a degree in Economics and took several computer science classes out of genuine interest. I soon began to realize that several months into my recruiting job that I did not like the work, but was still interested in software engineering. I did a lot of research and decided App Academy was the best bootcamp and I would strive to get in. I completed a web development udemy course as prep and a refresher, then applied, interviewed, and was accepted. The class was technically the in-person New York software engineer track but it was online due to Covid. I had some experience with software engineering and it\'s principals prior to App Academy, so the first few weeks of the course were nothing more than further review of things I had learned, but in a different language, Ruby (I believe courses now will use Python instead). Every day you have a lecture in the morning followed by projects to complete with a partner by pair programming. This is a good way to learn if you are both on the same level of understanding about the current subject, but can be frustrating when that is not the case. In the first two weeks of the course you have two exams, if you fail one of them you are suspended until the next cohort to study up and get a better understanding of the basics. If you cannot pass these exams or struggle to, you will not make it to the end. After those two weeks, you are allowed to fail two assignments. The first one you fail you do not have to retake, however, the second one you fail you must retake it later than day. If you fail it once again, you will be asked to leave the cohort, and you are not able to join another. I thought it is important to include that to know what you are getting into, it can be very stressful for some people, so please to your own studying and prep before you decide to do this course because it is extremely fast paced. Fully understanding all the material if you are learning it for the first time is unlikely. By the end of the course we had about 40 of our original clas size of 60 that graduated. After you graduate you are pretty much on your own, they give you a career coach but they are dealing with so many job seekers that they have minimal time for you per week (maybe 1-2 hours). I graduated on October 23rd and instantly began polishing up my final projects, resume, linkedin and other job seeking sites. After I was happy with how I was presenting myself, I went hard at Leetcode and did a dozen or two problems a day, making sure I was understanding them, and hitting a variety of subjects. By the end of my search I was capable of doing all easy problems and most medium level problems. While doing leetcode problems I would apply to jobs mostly on linkedin and google jobs. Technically, you are supposed to wait to apply to jobs until your career coach gives you the OK, but i went ahead and started applying anyways because it takes so long to get feedback from them. About 2 weeks into my job search I han\'t recieved anything back from any companies until I got a take home interview question from Draftkings. I was able to complete that (it was about OOP and building a companies organizational chart, so DFS was involved). I had a HR call the week after, and the week after than I had a virtual onsite (more OOP questions, working with json-like objects, talking about my projects, and whiteboarding (design a messaging app). I thought it all went really well, and a week later I was given an offer, which I accepted since I had NOTHING else in my pipeline. I felt I was pretty lucky to get a job only a month out of graduation, and that will certainly not happen to everyone. However, it happened to me and I pretty much tripled my salary from my last job. Bootcamps are worth it if you are able to handle the amount of information being thrown at you and you are ready to work non-stop for about 6 months with no pay (3 months at bootcamp, 3 months avg job search).

Read More I came in with knowledge of the basics of HTML &amp; CSS from creating a Wordpress blog a few years prior and doing some FCC and Codecademy training. At the time, I was considering multiple coding bootcamps and had never even heard of a/A, but once they were on my radar, the reviews made me confident that I would be pushed to my limit, which in my head translated to becoming a very capable software engineer through intense studies. Personally, my time was solely dedicated to 32 Weeks of a/A, so if you are unable to give your entire days to them, your process will be quite trying. 10-7, take a break for dinner/family, and then a few hours of homework/study afterwards. To be transparent, I haven\'t found my first role yet, and I am 3 months into the job search. I have a Bachelor\'s and Master\'s. It takes time, and the expectation given down to us is 400 - 600 applications at 25 minimum apps placed a week. I believe I\'m somewhere between 225 and 250 applications thus far. Please prep for this. Important Things To Note * Marketing - Take the marketing material for what it is. Yes, you can get a job making 100K in San Francisco or NY, but this is significantly harder for the online cohorts due to everyone being disbursed throughout the world. I can only speak from my experience, and my experience also tells me to let you know that you will be in the market looking for role for months if you are unwilling to move to hot spots, and many time if you are, it won\'t be for 100K. 100K is a lot of money if you didn\'t know, and companies expect a lot of those that are making the big bucks. Just frame your goals properly and know what you are signing up for. * Deferrals - I started right before Covid hit, so we were given additional opportunities to defer to later cohorts simply because of how much was going on at the time. To put it plain, once shutdowns were instated, no one was solely focused on school, family arrangements were different, and things just changed. Typically, I think you are given 3 deferrals, but 1 was added for us, making it a total of 4. I have seen people defer for medical reasons and family issues, but the most common is not passing assessments. There were around 14-15 assessments. Understand that deferrals is not a scare tactic. You will be removed from a/A and will also be required to pay a prorated amount if you end up not making it through the entire program. Read your agreements, please. For me personally, I deferred twice, making my total time in a/A 32 weeks compared to 24 weeks. That\'s an additional 2 months. There are weeks where 0 people defer, and then on the harder weeks, you will see double digits defer. Don\'t let it deter you too much. You will move to the cohort immediately behind you. There is 1 new cohort a month, so it places you 4 weeks back. On the positive side, this gives you the opportunity to reinforce concepts that didn\'t stick. It was well stated in my cohort(s) during our graduation that potential deferments induced more anxiety than anything else. That is where the stress lies due to you not knowing what the assessments could potentially have on them. Pressure makes diamonds, but pressure also busts pipes. * Finances - Plan accordingly. I was one who bet on myself and believed I could make it straight through without any deferrals, meaning, I chose not to do the contract and instead paid a portion up front. Well, I deferred twice. If I wouldn\'t have budgeted correctly, that extra two months out of work could have had long lasting implications and could have really hurt me. Be smart. * Skill Level - For the most part, a/A tests for the correct personality types in the pre-work/interview stage, but on day 1, you will soon realize that some people are just naturally gifted, have a little more experience, and there is really nothing you can do about it. They look for ambitious and driven personalities, but that isn\'t all that matters. Don\'t let this get you down. Those that are answering all of the questions and know alot more when you pair with them is great, but if you\'re not that person, it\'s not a death sentence either. We all learn in different ways and different speeds. * Technical Mentors &amp; Teaching Assistants Matter - Like college, I believe who is teaching you is equally as important as what you are learning. Speaking for myself, I didn\'t feel that I had the right mix of teachers until I made it into my last cohort. I felt like the mentors and ta\'s really fought for us when assessments were just unfair(timing or not good questions), and it genuinely felt like I had met my tribe. This has nothing to do with my previous cohorts, but honestly speaking, I didn\'t get that same feeling or attention. It made me regret starting when I did, meaning I came in halfway through a cohort once relationships had already been established and additionally, I had learned things in ways that were taught much better in the new cohort, etc... My cohort mates just seemed to be fundamentally stronger than I was at times, and I believe it was due to the culture that the TM and TA\'s created for the group. * Post Covid a/A Experience Is Different - Put simply, you\'re prone to be more of just a number. The pre-covid groups were small. Jan graduated ~11 , Feb graduated ~6, March graduated ~12, April graduated ~17, May graduated ~18.... Numbers ballooned severely after this. People are out of work and taking the opportunity to transition to new careers. The cohorts are now starting with 75+ students, leading them to have to change the way instruction is given as well. In my estimation, from those 75-90 students in a cohort, each graduation will now be anywhere from 30 - 40 students graduating. Just be aware that the small circles and having the little school experience is no longer there. * Students with kids under 5 - If your kids are at home during the day and you are the sole person responsible for them, I can\'t imagine how you will survive the curriculum. This is not extremely common, but there are some. In my case, I saw 3 different cases. Those 3 are no longer enrolled at a/A. This is not a scare tactic, but owing a company thousands of dollars is not a bright outcome, so make sure you have a daycare or someone to care for them. * Diversity - Simply put, not a ton of women and not a ton of color. For a graduation class of 17, 2 were black and 1 woman.Scholarships and marketing material(Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Instagram Ads) should be geared towards both of those communities. Slack channels for subsets of individuals is respectable and an attempt, but it\'s not enough. There also needs to be some diversity in the C-Suite roles. You can\'t understand people that you have no exposure to. * Curriculum - Pretty decent. I can only speak from the perspective that I never worked with most of the languages before doing it, so I can only compare it against FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy. From that lens, it was pretty good. There were weaker sections, but I also understand how tough it is to make changes, getting approval, and everything that comes with that process. Bottom Line: Don\'t expect too much when you are literally learning a new subject/concept pretty much every week. A personal frustration is that a lot of the projects were centered around building a game such as Tic-Tac-Toe, King\'s Travail, recreating Pokedex and things like that. So, I\'m not a gamer, and though many coders are, it was tough at times to keep my attention. Most of us aren\'t going into game development, so diversifying the selection of projects should be considered. E-Commerce sites, internal banking applications, you know, things that are actively being built in the market. Just a thought. * CareerQuest/Job Support - If you are opening up an online portion, naturally I believe a global partnerships team should also be rolled out. You have students across the world, but most opportunities presented are for NY and SF. Career Coaches are doing what they can I believe and have a lot on their plates. Overall, I\'m still going through this process, so my entire outlook is dependent on the first role I acquire. Let it be known that the student does the work though, the coaches are just their to hold you accountable. Trust, you can also get kicked out while searching for a job as well. There are still meetings you are required to attend weekly and the pressure lessens, but doesn\'t stop.Read Less','app-academy'),(1107,271501,'Challenging and Welcoming.','2020-12-17',0,5,5,5,5,'App Academy is a fast paced, challenging, web development course that claims it can teach people to code with no prior experience.

Read More is motivated by this. In short, your goals and theirs are aligned as long as you are committed. Speaking of alignment, you really will be paired with a coach for your entire job search, and you\'ll have the support of your classmates, assuming you connected well with them throughout the program. In sum, a/A offers tremendous researches to aid in your search, in addition to the thorough prep in the last couple weeks of the program.2. a/A is assessment-driven and engineering-focussed, meaning they don\'t carry dead weight—and more to the point, they do not have a reputation for allowing dead weight or for graduating web devs who don\'t really know how software works. You learn multiple languages. You learn algorithms and data structures. You build 2 solo projects and 2 group projects. It\'s intense. But... You are allowed up to 3 deferments. This is designed to give you the chance to have more time if you are struggling, and it also means that at a certain point, the unmotivated/less capable will be significantly challenged. That challenging is good for your skill and reputation as a potential a/A grad, so as long as you can keep up this is a plus. I found the rigor was typically held in good tension with empathetic instructors who want to support you well through what they know to be a high-paced 24 weeks.3. People! Students I reached out to prior to choosing a/A generally had great things to say about their experience. Reach out to a/A grads on LinkedIn who live near you, and you\'ll likely find the same. But what makes this difference? For me, it\'s the people. I had the best lead instructor I could\'ve imagined, and the TAs are generally of good quality as well. While every company likely has some instructors that fall below the curve, I really can say the instruction I received was personable, encouraging, and technically substantial. (There are some instructors that occasionally guest lectured for my cohort, and I liked them as well.) And the students? Amazing! I genuinely made a good handful of friends, and we voluntarily check in with each other as we each look for jobs. Yes, every class will have that person looking for a quick way to money, but even so they get weeded out or have a change of heart. And how can you not make friends when the average day consists of several hours pair-programming?I\'ve harped on about the strengths of App Academy. What are the weaknesses? I give the curriculum 3 stars—maybe 3.5 if that\'s allowed. But I actually really liked the curriculum, particularly the structure, pace, and topics, as well as the video instructors. a/A even updated it earlier in the year, so even recent language developments are covered. So why 3 stars? Simple: the videos are typically paired with homework in the form of article-style readings to be done the night before their topics are covered, and while many of the readings were fine, just as many were riddled with grammatical errors and unclear phrasing. Additionally, occasionally the code-along videos involved deprecation issues, leading to avoidable, class-wide encounters with bugs. While the deprecation issues are understandable, the lack of writing quality is not (aside from the classic engineering stereotypes that come to mind). None of these curriculum issues are reasons not to choose a/A. In fact, I bet every bootcamp faces these same challenges when it comes to keeping curriculum current and polished. These reasons do, however, provide for a point of growth on the part of App Academy, and I know they are aware of this and constantly improving, welcoming your constant feedback. You are, after all, required to provide it daily, and in my experience they take it really seriously. What makes this ultimately excusable for now is that students always have ample opportunity to ask questions on every single lecture topic, so you are always supported as you seek to master content. There wasn\'t a single topic for which I wasn\'t provided a live Q &amp; A. Ask away!A small but earnest point should be made before concluding. You really must take into account the length of job search and the possibility of deferment when thinking about how you will support yourself during the bootcamp. For many, 24 weeks is already a stretch. You\'ve got to ask yourself if you could be income-less for a year. While your career coach will understand if after the 24 weeks you feel that you simply must get a part time job, this will provide a ton of stress if you don\'t consider your worst cases before starting the bootcamp. This goes for any bootcamp, and even though I bet a/A\'s placement pace is relatively high compared with other programs (on average roughly 6 months after graduating), you simply can\'t afford to make a poor choice when it comes to your finances.Ultimately, joining App Academy was likely the best choice I could\'ve made in a year nothing went to plan. The ISA means they have skin in the game and are aligned with your goal of jump-starting your career. The rigorous, assessment-driven structure means you will actually become something by the time you are done. And the people are worth the cost of the late hours, tears, grit, and (deferred) money.

You will make a lot of mistakes and that is a good thing.Read Less','app-academy'),(1115,270271,'Tech is a second gold rush, and these folks sell shovels','2020-11-12',0,4.3,4,4,5,'I attended App Academy after graduating college with a degree in Ecology and working in the US Forest Service for three years. Basically, I had no technical experience whatsoever outside of playing video games and experimenting with basic coding in the... Read More language BASIC when I was a kid. After about 7 months total of coursework and the job search, I landed a job as a software engineer at a series C startup and I feel wholly prepared to assume my new role.App Academy has a pretty solid curriculum, and while you could conceivably learn it all on your own it\'s much more efficient to do it through them. While most of the TA\'s are recent A/a grads, the cohort leads are usually experienced engineers and can answer your in-depth technical questions. I\'m pleased to say there is a decent focus on true CS concepts rather than just how to use the trending tools of the industry, which is really what counts in the job search. Specific languages and tools go out of style rapidly, but if you can internalize the core concepts of CS and learn how to pick up new things on the fly, you will be able to apply to a wide range of jobs and have a chance of passing the interviews. Pair programming is one of the most infuriating experiences imaginable, but I will say that it is the secret sauce that makes this bootcamp work. Left to you own devices you will likely not be motivated or focused enough to work through the whole curriculum on your own, but when paired with another person all day it makes sure that both partners are on task and making good progress. I will say I love pair programming when two people can just freeform work on the project together and throw out the driver/navigator roles, and I encourage you to suggest this to your partners if both of you are on board.I would also say that while the A/a model works really well right now, it is definitely a crapshoot whether or not it will work for you or in the future. Right now tech is a bloated whale of high paying coding jobs that could be conceivably had with just 4-6 months of rigorous training, but I suspect that like the gold rush this will come to an end. Most of these jobs are for startups which are not profitable and are funded by VC cash. While I\'m not an economist, I have heard from people who are that the tech industry is likely overvalued and may crash in the same way that finance did in 2008. Just be wary, and have realistic expectations. At the time of this review I would 100% recommend App Academy as a viable option to a tech career, but if you are reading this a year or later down the line I would do my research into the state of the industry and bootcamp placements before registering. If you are older (say, 35+) or lack a degree you may also struggle to find a job as many companies will automatically weed you out for not having a degree or discriminate against you for being an older candidate. Ditto if you are not a citizen or green card holder. While I and many of my friends found jobs within 3-6 months of finishing the program (some even sooner), I also met many people who fit into the above categories who ended up searching for upwards of a year.The one place where App Academy really shines is the job search. This to me is where 90% of the value comes from. Anyone can learn how to code on their own, but I can honestly say without my dedicated and talented coaches I would have been dead in the water. They teach you things that you can\'t easily learn off the internet, things you wouldn\'t even think to google, and the job search formula works, at least in this current economy. Indeed, I did App Academy because I didn\'t think I could find a job in my old field (ecology), but after going through the job search curriculum I realize I total could have if I knew what I know now about job searching. Lastly, I\'d like to mention that my first coach was a dud and pretty useless, but after he left App Academy I was assigned to two new coaches who were total rockstars. My point is your milage may vary, but for the most part I would say the coaching staff is solid.Finally, read the fine print. The ISA money-back guarentee only applies if you finish the program and don\'t find a job after a year, and even then you will more than likely have to sign a job search extension adding extra months before you are eligible to get your money back. This is due to the fact that your projects and job search materials will likely not be done by the time you graduate and you will need to spend additional time working on these, during which time you are not technically job searching. Make sure that you are able to support yourself being fully unemployed for a period of 17ish months (4 months curriculum + 13 months for the search) before you start the program if you want to be safe. Of course you could just send it anyway, but you are running a risk as if you run out of money and have to go back to work you will still owe A/a $28K. Also, plan on moving to a tech hub city (most likely SF or NY) if you do not already live in one, these are the places where companies will hire bootcampers. I was lucky enough to score a remote job, but that is also mostly due to COVID. You may also be able to do so but again it is a crapshoot.Overall, I would recommend App Academy but only in an artifically inflated and booming tech economy.Read Less','app-academy'),(1116,270212,'Strenuous and at times annoying but in the end worth it.','2020-11-11',0,4.3,4,5,4,'Pros: -Great curriculum taught by competent and (mostly) empathetic instructors who want you to succeed. -If you can pass the curriculum as well as are giving a true best of yourself effort then you will learn to program.-Resources are plentiful during...

And we learned specific technologies like Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript, React/Redux, Node &amp; the MERN stack. We practiced using git &amp; github extensively. We learned Test Driven Development thru technologies like Rspec &amp; Capybara. Most importantly, we learned to learn.

I believe that this is part of the design, in a sense, because Ruby is an easy introduction into the world of programming. We had people that came from completely different backgrounds and had little prior programming experience. However, it\'s looking like Python &amp; Django are becoming more popular now and I wish we had some exposure to these frameworks as well. It appears that future aA cohorts will, in-fact, be going this route instead of RoR.2) While aA has a wealth of knowledge on App Academy Open - the main tool for content for our curriculum (it\'s where all of our projects, homework, and readings were housed), that portal is not very organized. If I wanted to go back and reference something we learned 4-5 weeks back - it was hard to find.

I don\'t remember anyone being unapproachable. Criticisms:* When students get deferred to another cohort, they simply disappear. I understand it may be embarrassing to defer (although it shouldn\'t be - life happens, you need more time, it didn\'t click), but just silently removing them might not be the best solution. I felt the cohort steadily shrinking as people left, and became increasingly stressed that it would happen to me, since we were the first cohort of the year and the students ahead of us had different curriculum and couldn\'t join us. Most other cohorts will not be in this situation, though, as they will have new students join.* The 24 week pace isn\'t as consistent as I\'d like. The first 4 weeks are essentially just making sure you passed the free online intro to programming course that they offer, or getting you up to speed if you didn\'t. It very quickly ramps up, and some weeks have very difficult assessments while other weeks see a class average of 100%. I understand some material is very hard to assess, though - such as learning a new framework or database, where it is more trivia than anything else. Final jurisdiction:I had graduated from uni without much of a portfolio, and without the ability to pass coding interviews despite my degree.

Or at the very least, will help equip you to continue learning more on your own after the bootcamp is over - It\'s recognized as one of the top bootcamps, which is significant since bootcamps can have a stigma associated with them in the actual workplace- The TAs seem to genuinely want everyone to succeed, and the fact that they are all former students makes them more empathetic to the pressure on current studentsCONS:- Curriculum or general operating procedures don\'t seem as polished as they could be. Several of the recorded video lectures towards the middle of the curriculum seem more dated, which didn\'t instill the highest sense of confidence in the product that App Academy provides- Intense focus on passing assessments. As other reviews mention, the foundation of the curriculum is based on weekly (and towards the end, bi-weekly) assessments. Failing any of the fundamentals assessments (weeks 1 and 2) results in being deferred to another cohort, and failing any 2 of the 6 remaining assessments results in dismissal. While this certainly keeps students on their toes, it also results in prioritizing just passing the assessment over understanding the concepts, especially if you don\'t have any prior CS knowledge- Pair-programming for hours every day, especially over Zoom, is taxing. Pair programming is clearly a huge part of the App Academy experience, but as one of the first cohorts that was taught the in-person curriculum entirely over Zoom, it would have been preferable to see App Academy try to be more creative in addressing specific needs of an online experience All in all, if you\'re looking for a way to accelerate your journey into becoming a software engineer, feel that you have a good support system, and are ready to work really hard, a bootcamp might be the right choice for you.Read Less','app-academy'),(1154,266771,'So glad I did App Academy.','2020-07-24',0,5,5,5,5,'Honestly, I was convinced at the beginning that App Academy wasn’t for me.

You have freedom to breathe and structure yourself as well.- It is arguably the # 1 coding bootcamp -- according to stats by a/A) -- and for the reasons I mentioned above.The cons of App Academy are:- If you opt for the ISA then you do have to pay them back $31,000 total at the most, which is definitely overpriced (but with a SWE or Software Engineer\'s salary it is easy to pay off I guess).- As of 2020 for the online program, the curriculum needs serious revising and oversight. In the readings, there are numerous typos, grammatical errors, misleading statements that confuse the amateur, and also inaccurate coding instructions in projects that derail students and waste a lot of precious time. There are usually better outside sources that teach the same topic better. It is not exactly the same curriculum as their successful in-person curriculum model at SF and NY. Throughout the 6 months of the online full-time course, they were slow to revise, update, change, correct video, reading, exercises material and resources.- Not all of their instructors and career coaches are competent for the job (at least for the online program I attended). Some lack in expertise of subject-matter. Those that are proficient in subject matter are either deficient in teaching skills or completely do not know how to teach effectively (this is coming from a former teacher at all levels and a world-class curriculum developer). Their hiring team is questionable since they are behind hiring their TAs, instructors and coaches for the reasons just stated.- They do not offer an official piece of paper (if that matters to anyone) such as a diploma, certificate as-of-to-date. I\'m also not sure about academic credits, you should ask them. They might incorporate this in the future.- You will not at all be ready when you graduate (if you are coming from a non-CS and non-tech background). You have to put in the smart and hard work and discipline yourself after graduation for a few more months to reach a level of adequacy as a Web Developer/Coder (let alone a Software Engineer). Going through the program will not do that for you (again if you are coming from a non-CS and non-tech background). I feel like this definitely could be remedied with better curriculum development (emphasis on depth of knowledge rather than breadth like replacing the time and effort to learn some extraneous techs with more emphasis on constructing more projects and polishing them up and learning one tech stack really well since the rest can be self-taught) and to get a better hiring team to get real teachers in there, but alas! My valuable counsel has been ignored as far as I\'m concerned.- You will have to pay them back even if you don\'t land a coding/web development/software engineering job with the conditions above.- The language in their legal contract before you are accepted is extremely skewed in their favor and oppressive, so if enough students voice their concerns and demand slight changes this will be better in terms of fairness.Read Less','app-academy'),(1173,266287,'Best Bootcamp!','2020-07-09',0,4.7,5,4,5,'I had an awesome time at App Academy learning everything from square one.

It has been incredibly stressful and it only got more stressful as the months rolled on. But if you try as hard as you can, you can get through it. You just can\'t give up. The course itself teaches you a lot of really marketable skills and I think they do a really good job of teaching those skills. Is it perfect? No. At this point it is hard to look at my own criticism and know whether it is valuable or just the product of my 6 month long high stress level. I guess if I don\'t get hired, it will probably validate those criticisms, but as I go on linkedin and see all of the a/A grads getting hired, it seems like if you follow the steps and commit yourself, that you will be rewarded.

I was disappointed at every turn. Time and time again, a/A staff proved to be highly disconnected with each other, and there was a deep sense of disorganization.... Read More (One eg: for about a month my instructor (someone who\'d graduated from a/A 1 year prior, with no other software dev experience) actively wrote the day by day curriculum that we were actually taking.) Having attended the online curriculum, I can only speak to that: there were few to no attempts made by staff in order to foster a sense of community among the cohort, even as they spoke of such measures being undertaken (in an official capacity) in the in-person cohorts.These faults (among others) might be admissible if the curriculum was very strong. The fact of the matter is that the written material for the Ruby course (still as of this writing freely available through a/A Online) is an amazingly written curriculum. The JavaScript portions (over half of the material), however, were a far cry from this standard. It was evident the material had not been updated, in some cases, for years. One of the things I truly disliked about going through a/A was that there were several times where I asked my instructor for help with a problem given in the curriculum, and they were unwilling (in one case) or unable (in another two cases) to help me. Now, I can\'t really fault someone who is out of school for a year, and who doesn\'t have any real life experience whatsoever to not know the intricacies of what I was asking (which at least in one case went above and beyond the curriculum), but I found it egregious that there was no system of escalation in place. Was there really no technical instructor in a/A\'s roster that could take some minutes to walk through an implementation of Knuth\'s Algorithm X?These are only a couple of the gripes that I had with the system. They had feedback tools available, which I used in order to tell them about all of these incidents in turn, as they happened. I never once saw resolution, and no one ever reached back out to me about my issues. It seems to me that this shows a/A is simply very disorganized at a very high level, in need of some serious reshuffling of priorities.As I write, my cohort is graduating in 2 days and we are starting the job search portion of the program. I have hopes for this portion still, because I figure that getting me a job is really a/A\'s core business, far and away from teaching me to code.

The instructors are amazing(shoutout to Soon-Mi, Bryce Morgan, John-Michael Riley, you guys are the best), and I met a lot of really awesome people at a/A. Cons: Lectures could definitely be more interactive, a few people surprisingly got through admissions and weighed down classmates hard(If you actually did the prep-work before applying, don\'t worry, this probably won\'t be you), and new material towards the end was rushed. Is it possible to learn all of this on your own? Most definitely, but you have to be out of this world dedicated to learn it in a similar amount of time.Clearing up a Misconception: Not everyone will need to put 80+ hours a week, in fact, I might even say if you\'re the type of person that will go all-in for a short period of time, say just a few weeks, then completely burn out, this is not the proper strategy to getting the most out of a/A. I used to be one of those people, but I learned to have dedicated time away from work. I would either finish the homework as soon as class ended or finish it just before going to bed, and the rest of my time was spent with friends, family, or alone doing anything other than looking at programming. By doing this I was able to be fully rested everyday and managed to not only get through the material avoiding burnout, but retain most of the information. This approach may not be for everyone, but this was my experience so I think it\'s worth considering when imagining your time at a/A.Context: I\'m definitely an outlier when it came to attending a/A, I started teaching myself programming since middle school and started a/A just a few days after turning 18. My prior experience barely helped me absorb the material better, and so long as you complete the prep-work, you\'ll be on track.

BUT you have to be ready to put in a tremendous amount of passion, dedication, time, and effort. There\'s no magic secret to App Academy... It\'s just a lot of hard work. No one can learn to code for you, and no one can get a job for you... That\'s all on you! But App Academy provides you with all the tools and support you need, and it was a truly life changing experience for me. The core curriculum (as it was when I attended) is incredible - I can\'t praise it enough. You don\'t just learn web development frameworks, you learn how they work under the hood. The TA\'s are always willing to help you when you run into issues, no matter how long it takes. And your fellow cohort mates will be fun to work with! A lot of students (including myself) were dubious of pair programming in the beginning... And although it\'s not perfect, the pros far outweigh the cons. Communicating your code to others is a make-or-break skill in the job search, and pair programming is a great way to develop that skill. Some days of pairing will be better than others, but that\'s just life haha. If you\'re worried about the workload, don\'t be. Well ok... maybe worry a little haha. App Academy will keep you busy all day, every day for the entirety of the program, weekends included. This is especially true if you\'re striving for a deep understanding of the material (which you should be!). But learning software development is a fun and rewarding process, and although the workload was immense, I found it enjoyable. There will be times when you feel overwhelmed, but there\'s a strangely satisfying feeling that comes from being thrashed day after day after day haha. I think the most difficult part is the end of the course when you\'re building your own projects. I\'m a perfectionist, so I put a lot of pressure on myself, and worked very long hours. I had no school or prior experience, so I knew my portfolio would be a critical part in showing off my abilities as a developer. Once projects are completed, you will move into the job search, which is a completely different challenge. You have to balance sending out plenty of applications, preparing for interviews and continuing to learn and grow as a developer. You will be responsible for structuring your days and holding yourself accountable, and it\'s really easy to get lazy and unmotivated (I know I did), especially when your pipeline is empty. Also, don\'t expect your career coach to get you a job - there\'s only so much they can do. To give some detailed job search stats, I sent out a total of 333 applications, which resulted in 8 phone screens, 3 coding challenges, 2 on-sites, and 1 job. I was extremely fortunate.All in all, App Academy was an amazing experience. However, it seems like App Academy is growing and changing, as all companies do.

There are a ton of projects but it seemed like the goal was exposure not necessarily building a portofilio (until the last weeks). You have assistance when you need it and hopefully a fun partner each day that you work with. There were a few projects/assignments that I really enjoyed and some that I really didn\'t. Some projects are very applicable to the real world, (building websites, designing, constructing games/apps) while others are very scholastic(working on algorithms/math type problems, and writing lite versions of complicated stuff so you have a better understanding or appreciation). I honestly feel like some of the scholastic projects could be removed and the course would be enhanced. The two months are working solo as well as in a team to develop multiple web applications from scratch (from a pre-approved list). You will also make a portfolio and prepare for the job search (with readings and homework).

Feel free to check out my portfolio for samples of the types of projects. www.samgutierrez.com(strikes)App Academy does have a policy in place to hold people accountable to their work and being in class. For the most part, I see it as generous. You really can\'t be kicked out if you are doing what you are supposed to. The Job Search: After you complete your projects and your official last day the hard work isn\'t over.You are given a career coach who work with you to get you ready for the job search. He or she will require multiple things to be met each week. You must get a certain number of points per week and a certain number of application or you are given a strike. Personal tips:Don\'t over commit yourself.My marathon:I had already committed a couple months of training prior to signing up for a/A. This would be my second marathon and 10th or so long run event. I was on track for a 3:30 marathon PB but the marathon was not until 4 months later. Rather than paying to downgrade my marathon to a half or 10k ($100 bucks to do so), i just opted to continue with it. My training regiment had me doing a small amount of miles at the start of the course so the first month felt like a breeze. However, the next 21 weeks were living and breathing code and more strenuous running workouts. My schedule consisted of waking up early in the morning (after late evenings of homework) and training for my marathon for about an hour with long runs on weekends. Aside from that, I quickly began battling over tightness of my quads that never let up (and eventually led to injury). I got to 3 months into the course before I started experiencing Achilles issues. By the time the marathon came around I was not in good shape. Mentally exhausted from the course work and assessments and dealing with the Achilles issues, as well as unforeseen family medical emergency. There were days when I couldn\'t even run a mile before my Achilles just forced me to walk. Luckily, I abandoned my PB goal and was now just focused on not injuring myself but foolishly kept pushing. I ended up completing the marathon in 5 hours and 20 mins. Was it worth it....maybe? lol It felt like a bigger accomplishment than my first marathon but of course but the damage had been done. I am still struggling with Achilles injury (3 months after marathon) and fell behind during the most difficult, and honestly what I felt like, the most important portion of the course. Of course with no longer having to train, I was able to manage to get myself up to par but at more stress. My advice, think long and hard about committing to anything during this time.

Laptops are good but honestly I feel like the $300 used imac that I bought is so much easier to work on then the macbook pro I worked on for one day. It is a world of difference having to constantly minimize or drag things around just to see your code. Set up your equipment somewhere where you will not having distractions (this will be super important during assessments) but will also help your day to day. I moved my equipment from a second bedroom (with one window) to my living room with 3 because it got more daylight. This made a huge difference in my productivity because I felt the day longer (didn\'t get tired as easily), could hear birds chirping instead of the neighbor\'s kids on their trampoline, and could also let my dogs play outside while I monitored them through the window (as opposed to keeping them cooped all day and feeling guilty)! The sunlight also keeps you sane because depending on your time zone you may not actually be outside during daylight otherwise.

Not a serious issue though because a/A\'s written and video resources are fantastic, and all the instructors are super capable engineers that can help you track down and conceptually understand any bug you hit in your code.

The days i got away with having my laptop in lecture, i was completely focused took incredible notes in notion, and learned a bunch.

When it comes to the curriculum, there are parts I definitely disagree with but overall they jam pack you with more than you\'ll ever be able to grasp all at once. Which is excellent. From high level algorithms to LRU Cache, and hashing functions, to understanding the foundations of a MVC framework. They definitely need to teach hooks in React though, and get away from only teaching class Components. It\'s out of date, compile rate is way slower and the industry is staying away from class Components, unless its dealing with error handling. They need to teach less ruby and more React. Ruby is a really beautiful but also a really easy language. The amount of time they focus on it is probably better spent elsewhere.Job Support so far is alright, everything seems to out of order though. Not sure where to go or what to do most times.

After I graduate, I will be working with a career coach from App Academy for upwards of a year until I find a job. Once you graduate, it doesn\'t stop - they expect you to spend 8 hours a day, 40 hours of week working on finding a job. If you work better with imposed deadlines, then this is immensely helpful as it prevents you from procrastinating. Overall - I think that the program is worth the value in tuition. I would recommend payment upfront rather than the deferred model, since you pay less and there\'s less pressure to find a job after you graduate. But if you like that sort of pressure, then maybe the second option is better for you after all. If I could do it over, I\'d definitely attend App Academy again.Read Less','app-academy'),(1256,263129,'An Amazing Experience','2020-03-31',0,5,5,5,5,'There\'s certainly a reason they call it a bootcamp.

The curriculum is rich enough that even the more experienced programmers will feel like they\'re getting something out of it. I can\'t recommend this program enough for those that are looking for a bootcamp. However, my main suggestion is that prior to applying or even considering this bootcamp, you should learn to code. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but the purpose of a bootcamp is not just to teach you how to code, it\'s to help get a job to build a career. In addition, learning to code prior gives you a sense on whether or not you even enjoy learning how to code. If you do, then definitely put in some time to learn prior to applying. It not only prepares you for the admissions interview but also will help you immensely in the program. App Academy is incredibly competitive and while there are many people that come into this program with little to no knowledge of how to code and ultimately succeed, there are many that don\'t make it pass the first few weeks. This is simply because the program has a strike out policy where if they deem that you\'re too far behind in their expectations of where you should be, you could get dismissed. App Academy is a great investment and I highly recommend that those that are considering this program will also consider the time and commitment. Everyone will do whatever it takes to make sure that you learn the material and get that job but only if you\'re willing to do your part in that process as well.Pros:• Rich curriculum of learning full-stack development and job searching • Has career coaches that work extensively to help you find a job • Relatively affordable: for those that can\'t pay the entire tuition out of pocket, the deferred plan is a great option that asks for a deposit and a fraction of your first year\'s income. This is a great choice because other bootcamps have policies that extend over 1 year and the repayment is little compared to what you\'ll be making as a software engineer. • Learn by doing: The curriculum emphasizes learning by doing. So you\'ll be working on a lot of projects but don\'t worry. The projects are not expected to be completed. They\'re meant to be for YOUR learning experience.Cons:• San Francisco is expensive. If you don\'t live in San Francisco, expect to dedicate some time commuting to and from the campus (SF traffic sucks). • Doesn\'t necessarily take into account everyone\'s learning style. I learn better when I\'m coding along with someone but lectures don\'t allow for computers so it\'s difficult to pay attention when I have to write notes with pen and paper while trying to follow lecture slides. • Too much pair programming: App Academy focuses on pair programming to get students to learn how to communicate and work with partners. This style is the majority of the program. It would be nice if we had more days to work by ourselves to learn the material at our own pace.Read Less','app-academy'),(1260,263093,'Great way to learn new technologies for beginners','2020-03-30',0,3.3,4,3,3,'Pros:-great support system from TA\'s-learn a ton in a very short amount of time-you get to meet a great cohort of like-minded individuals, largely who will become your network in the futureCons:-instruction can sometimes seem unorganized-some lectures...

However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy\'s curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can\'t stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum.3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It\'s just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you\'ll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you\'re not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn\'t to show that App Academy is easy, it\'s to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum.Read Less','app-academy'),(1262,263087,'Overall Positive Experience','2020-03-30',0,3.3,4,4,2,'Pros: Technologies being taught are applicable to the industry which is nice.

You just can\'t get the reputation a 4 year degree will get you at a bootcamp. Especially considering how undergraduate internships are the new start of the pipeline to full time employment. The job search portion is arguably more grueling due to financial stress and comparative lack of structure.

It is not imperative that you fully understand everything from that course, but a general idea of the concepts helped me excel at App Academy. I came from a political science background, but I understood programming concepts thanks to predicate logic, the Harvard Edx course, and from video games. So, you do not need extensive knowledge of coding, but attending App Academy without some exposure is a mistake.The program itself is rather rigorous and you will find that you live under a rock for the duration of it. Our cohort had the easiest time because our program aligned with several holidays. Nevertheless, I found myself skipping my normal gym routine in favor of late-night studying.

I often thought I could rest and make up for lost time later that night, but when I compared my pace to my classmates, I found that not only were they working while I was resting, but even during the hours I felt I could pull ahead. Simply put, there is no escaping the time-sink involved in this type of program. When we finished the material and began personal projects, I found myself running on four hours of sleep per night.How enjoyable the experience is will largely depend on your fellow students. I felt as if I shared a lot of experiences with my cohort and that they made the experience enjoyable. It is impossible for me to say whether other cohorts will be as exceptional. You will find yourself interacting with at least half the cohort due to paired programming and your breaks will be spent discussing the material. Personally, I enjoyed pair programming since I value the time I spend with my cohort, but some people felt it was not as enjoyable -- it really depends on your preferences. My biggest criticisms of this program are its strike policy and location. As previously mentioned, you accrue strikes while sick and that inclined people to attend class, with the flu, during my time at App Academy. My other criticism is that it is located in rather expensive places. It might not be feasible to relocate, but New York and San Francisco are infamously expensive locations and are not necessarily the nicest places (In terms of cleanliness). Be prepared to budget if you attend. I know some people mitigate this cost by traveling from afar, but given the tedium of the program, I would highly advice against it.Overall, I think the program pushes acquainted individuals to become great software engineers.I wouldn\'t recommend it to people with zero exposure to coding, but a little preparation will alleviate that concern.

This bootcamp will teach you very basic fundamentals early on and then transition quickly into being focused on frontend web development. The practical skills taught are all in frontend frameworks. This is great to train students to be able to jump into a junior frontend role and be productive, but not so great if you desire to work backend. Now of course a/A is just providing the building blocks to launch students into a career in software development and students can certainly transition into a backend role, but it likely won\'t be the first job after a/A. The program is 16 weeks and can not replace a CS degree. A lot of self-study is necessary right after the program ends to shore up deficiencies in the data structures and algorithms.As for the SF campus, the building is located in Financial District / Embarcadero which means rent will be very expensive if you want to live nearby. If you are moving to SF, look for housing right away after being accepted and see if you can find a roommate with a fellow student in the cohort.

In the end, there were only... Read More 10 of us left(including a coder that was rolled back into our group). Even though App Academy hours are from 8 am - 5 pm pacific time, there is usually a few hours of homework and readings every night as well. I usually found myself going to bend around midnight to 2 am studying every night since I was in central time.In addition there are six assessments which you must score around an 85% to 90% or better in order to pass or after two fails you may be asked to leave the program. So between studying for these assessments to remain in the program, doing the nightly homework videos, readings and coding projects where you are expected to take on and learn new content, and the daily grind of 8 am to 5 pm (or 10 am to 7 pm if you are in the mid-west), and any ongoing projects or other fun homework that might be assigned, you might find yourself incredibly busy.During the week it is pretty much impossible to find time to get out or do anything social. I made sure to keep myself active though and workout daily. I think the assessments create a very stressful learning environment for the students and aren\'t a good measure of a coders ability. I saw many coders very stressed about the upcoming assessments. For some this brings out the best and motivates people to do better. For others, they would simply self-destruct.What I love about App Academy is that it has taught me to think like a coder instead of having to resort to copy and paste or following tutorials to create websites, write backends, set up API endpoints, create games, or manage the flow of an app. I feel confident that I can build anything or learn any new kind of technology stack very quickly and use the thought process that I have gained from App Academy. I was bummed at first that they taught Ruby as I consider it a dying language(Yes Ruby is still in demand). Even though it has many easy and useful and methods that can making coding much faster and simpler, it appears that it is not being used nearly as much by companies as Javascript, Python, Java, and some other languages. (By the way App Academy is switching to Python and I am excited to get access to their content). However, App Academy taught me Javascript as well, React, the MERN stack with MongoDB. I learned GraphQL, docker, postresql, how to make GeoQueries, organize my code better, and take advantage of object oriented programming. I mastered algorithms, recursion, data structures, became great at debugging and learned many other things.Their curriculum is on a whole other level from what you will usually find. If you complete the course, you will a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, how servers work, requests, responses, big-O, LRU cache, optimizations and many other things. We did things like creating our own version of Rails Active Record to see how Ruby on Rails worked behind the scenes. We did the same thing with JQuery. Once again, its more than just copy and paste. It\'s real understanding that you can take to any other endeavor.And what I have found, when picking up a new language, framework or stack, is that the thought process is pretty much the same. I have been able to teach myself Dart to make mobile apps in Flutter and pick up python very quickly just using the techniques and knowledge that I gained from App Academy.The Instructors are excellent, brilliant problem solvers, very knowledgeable and almost always available, even on the weekends or if you have a late night question.I am currently about to start the Job Search phase, so we will see how this converts to finding a job.

The principal three-month curriculum is incredibly intense—expect 60-hour weeks at absolute minimum—but it takes you through the skills and concepts you need to know and forces you to put in the necessary work to really learn them. The instructors and TAs, though they can occasionally be overwhelmed (many are graduates of the course), are always on hand to offer helpful feedback that’s often critical to bringing together your understanding of a concept. It’s all about putting you in a structure that incentivizes you to actually put in the work, and this continues even after graduation, as you get individualized coaching and reporting tools that make sure you regularly apply to jobs and continue working on projects and coding challenges. This is especially valuable because the job search can take time—around three months in my case—and you’ll absolutely have more to learn after you graduate. Twelve weeks can’t cover every nuance of software engineering. As far as downsides, the instruction is sometimes shaky, as I said above, though years in business have polished the curriculum to the point where you’ll usually have pre-prepared resources to help you out if worst comes to worst. Your continued participation in the course depends on you passing the regular assessments, which is a major source of stress even if you have a handle on the material and prepare well. The assessments themselves also can feel more like tests of memorization than genuine reflections of how much you’ve learned. Last but not least, despite App Academy’s stated (and admirable) goal of bringing people from more diverse backgrounds into the tech industry, most of the classes seem to be overwhelmingly male, even more so than the industry as a whole. That won’t be an issue for everybody, but it’s worth mentioning. Still, I have no regrets.

However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy\'s curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can\'t stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum. 3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It\'s just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you\'ll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you\'re not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn\'t to show that App Academy is easy, it\'s to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum. Closing thoughts:I definitely don\'t know as much as those who dedicated every minute of their lives studying and working on App Academy, but I can confidently say that I was one of the happiest people there and truly enjoyed everyday of my experience with low stress. My approach was all about balance in my life, and I succeeded and made it to the end! Obviously, people work differently. If you need to lose some sleep to catch up on studying, that\'s fine. If you need even less days to study and can spend all weekend relaxing, that\'s fine too. I think the main thing is to not worry about what/how others are doing, and only focus on yourself and what YOU need to be successful and healthy.Read Less','app-academy'),(1375,256301,'Difficult but rewarding','2019-10-10',0,5,5,5,5,'App Academy was a difficult program but rewarding when you get through it.

At times, TAs will have to ask another TA for help to help the student. Curriculum review:As some reviews have already stated, the JavaScript curriculum needs to be more refined. A majority of App Academy grads will find positions as front end developers or become full stack developers but their job will have them primarily do front end stuff. I think, due to this fact, App Academy focuses too much on front end. App Academy is continuously tweaking their program and I hope that they shorten the ruby section and make the JavaScript section more extensive by covering node.js and express.js in depth instead of just focusing on React / Redux. As for CSS and HTML, which App Academy dedicates time to teaching, I think it is better to leave students to learn from the great and free online resources out there. Just assign homework that needs to be completed and turned in to make sure students do the CSS. Culture: App Academy states that it is a professional environment but it is far from it. They will take violations of their diversity and inclusion principles very seriously but besides that, App Academy does not enforce students to keep professional behavior. This leads to a more relaxed environment, which helps the social aspect of the boot camp, but does get in the way of focusing on coding since people are allowed to have loud conversations about any topic they want without consequences.

Should you apply for a coding boot camp? I can\'t give you a straight answer for this because it depends on your situation. But in my... Read More case, it was worth it for me, since my goal was to learn about full-stack web development and software engineering to be as fast as possible. I think App Academy does a great job at that, and you will be surprised at how quickly you can learn here. It would have taken me far longer of self-studying to be where I\'m at today. Not to mention, I\'ve also made some great friends along the way that I talk to every day.2. How should one prepare before applying to App Academy? I did the intro-to-programming section offered on https://www.aaonline.io and felt that I was ready to schedule a technical interview with AA. I was not, I failed my first interview and was lucky enough to get invited back for another. After failing, I realized that I needed much more practice. I practiced on https://www.codewars.com every day up until my next interview. You need to time yourself and talk out loud through the problem-solving process, preferably to a friend or family member. You should also be very comfortable working with arrays and hashes in Ruby and solving problems that may require nested loops. Sidenote: https://www.leetcode.com is another excellent place to practice. 3. How many hours per week to get through the program? Like many have said before me, this boot camp is no joke. Even if you put in 80+ hours per week, you will only be scratching the surface of the topics covered. But this is the tradeoff of getting yourself job-ready as fast as possible.4. How stressful is the program? If you have no programming experience, you will need to study hard to pass the six assessments. They cover Ruby algorithms, Ruby Object-Oriented Programming, SQL, Ruby on Rails, React, and JavaScript. If you fail two of the assessment tests, you must retake one of their choosing. If you fail the retake test, you will be booted out. Yes, it\'s stressful, but keep your focus on the material and the great job that you\'re going to get out of it, and you\'ll be fine.5. How is the curriculum? I think that some of the newer content at the end of the curriculum could use some improvement. But for the most part, it\'s fantastic. I know some people may be turned off by Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but don\'t worry about it, you will also build full-stack applications with the MERN stack.6. How are the instructors? From my experience, they were knowledgable and friendly. Leave the ego at the door and pick their brains as much as possible. They are a valuable resource. 7. What is a day like at App Academy? At 8 AM we would meet on Zoom, the instructors would cover the daily material before splitting us up into random pairs to work on the day\'s projects. Throughout the day, we had access to the instructors to ask them questions. About an hour before the end of the day, we would all meet to cover the material in the day\'s project.

The satisfaction of creating your own functional website from scratch is very satisfying, kind of like the cherry on top of the program. If I could complain about one thing, it would probably be the amount of videos we had to watch during class on certain days.

Right off the bat once the immersive portion kicked into high gear, we got exposure to Git, data structures,... Read More and we were pair programming daily through the day’s projects. The curriculum is well structured for layering in new technologies, and before you know it you’re familiar with relational databases and doing a deep dive into the inner workings of Rails. Things move at a bewildering pace, and it’s very easy to get caught off guard by this early on if you’re not careful. The looming thought of getting kicked out over failing two assessments can be extremely unsettling, but this risk/reward setup also puts the entirety of the cohort into a hyper focused mindset. And it creates a unique environment for learning if you can sublimate the anxiety of it. Even through the online setup, it was surprising just how much there was a sense of community. You spend hours every day with your classmates, and even through a computer screen I felt like I got to know a lot of them really well. I don’t know how they’re able to isolate so many brilliant people into these cohorts, but they clearly have very efficient and calculated screening mechanisms in place to ensure they’re taking quality people into the program. The TA’s are fantastic. The student to teacher ratio is very favorable for student teacher interactions, and they were consistently pivotal in getting me on track with the material on pace to get through the assessments. It’s a lot of information so be 100% prepared to have no life while you’re working through the curriculum. I thought 100 hours a week would be an exaggeration but I was consistently logging 95-100 hours each week studying the material straight through the weekend. You get to build your own full stack project using the core stack of the curriculum, as well as other projects with additional technologies that you learn past the React portion of the course. They’re in a re-vamping phase with their curriculum with less of a focus on Ruby as far as I understand, so this is something to bear in mind moving forward. I’m confident that however they re-structure the curriculum will be just as effective as the current setup they have in place and I’m sure it’s necessary given the industry’s trending away from Rails, but any large scale overhaul of a curriculum carries with it at least some amount of risk. I felt like the React portion was great. Past that things were still mostly well structured with minor hiccups. There were portions I felt were too rushed. For example, we had about a weekend to learn the MERN stack before we were working in a team to build an application in it that following week. Pieces of this curriculum might need some revision. Maybe something as simple as having at least one additional project with the MERN stack before having students code in a team environment in it. However I really enjoyed the Docker portion of the curriculum, and it was fun building an additional project with GraphQL / Apollo. I’ve heard this part of the curriculum is at the moment isolated to the online setups. You get to build a project in Vanilla JavaScript at the end of the course as well. App Academy’s deferred payment plan was a strong draw for me personally. I felt that this established them as an institution willing to take on a lot of risk investing in the people they take into the program, and shows that they’re confident their curriculum will get people placed in well-paying positions upon finishing. I’d honestly like to see more institutions of higher education adopt a similar financing approach. There are pros and cons to deciding on doing the online setup instead of an in-person setup, and I do believe an in-person setup would have been very fulfilling. Some people would say the in person setup is vital to the whole App Academy experience. But I do like that the online setup at least had a longer space of time for absorbing the material. You get a month prior to the official immersive portion of the cohort to get solid with software engineering fundamentals. And the TA’s were always readily available to answer any questions I might have, so at least on the learning side there was nothing lost in translation going this route. An in person bootcamp really wasn’t feasible for me personally, and I would expect it’s not for many others planning on applying.

Even though we paused the videos to go over any questions, it was degrees of magnitude less engaging compared to when we were live doing it all together. 2. As soon as we got into the Career Quest portion of the curriculum, things seemed to have derailed in terms of organization. Our TAs didn\'t seem to know what was on the schedule, especially towards the beginning of the Career Quest curriculum. 3. Add a search functionality to the curriculum materials!! Especially during full stack projects, I needed to refer back to materials on how to do one specific thing and it was so difficult without a search. 4.

Once I had decided that the bootcamp path was one I would take, I began the arduous task of selecting the RIGHT bootcamp. Ultimately, I decided that an in-person program was the right fit for my learning style. Living in the SF Bay Area, there seemed to be two choices. I asked friends and family, that work in the tech industry, to take a look at the syllabi, read all the reviews, and had a few sleepless nights. I ultimately chose App Academy as the school I wanted to attend, participated in their online bootcamp prep program, and a few months later I was rewarded with acceptance into their program. Then the really difficult part began . . .  This program is intense, it\'s designed that way and they make no apologies about it. You are forced to constantly learn new material, never truly feeling comfortable before the next topic is laid before you. A week into the course, I was sure that I would not make it. I came home everyday to my wife and told her that I had no idea what was going on, that I was barely hanging on, that many other people surely had a better grasp of the material and I was doomed. I spent hours each day after class and every weekend up at the school, working on homework or studying for assessments. App Academy is quick to point out that almost everyone has these feelings, and it\'s Imposter Syndrome in full effect. They chose you for a reason, they say. You are supposed to be here. For myself, these feelings of inadequacy continued through the course. Though you do get comfortable with a general feeling of unease and helplessness. I will also say, that despite these feelings, I did feel supported throughout the program. I could ask questions whenever I wanted, help was available from TAs and my fellow students. The bonds formed in this stressful situation, and the assistance that you are able to both receive and give to those around you helps keep you grounded and headed towards the finish line. I\'ve heard a lot of talk about the structure of Assessments, and the policy of being asked to leave if you fail 2 of them. Is the system perfect? No, it is not. Is fear an amazing motivator? Yes, it certainly is. Is watching good, hardworking, smart people walk out the doors early a painful experience? Without a doubt. Is there a better way to do it? I truly don\'t know. But that is the process that App Academy has chosen, so just know what you are getting into. If you are not able to calm yourself down in extremely stressful testing situations, these tests are going to be hard. But, if you do the work, if you go over the practice tests and make attempts to understand the material to the best of your ability, if you are honest with yourself about the information you do not understand and ask questions, you will be fine. If I made it through, you can too. As I write this, I am at the end of the program, with just a few days left. The Job Search part of the program is much different than the instructional portion. There is much less structure, the occasional lecture on soft skills, networking, reumés, interviewing questions, and further work on some algorithms and data structures. Some people enjoy this portion, some hate it. Some feel abandoned, some use it to finally focus on what they really find interesting. I don\'t really have any issues with it. I\'m happy to be provided with the school\'s perspective on how to get a job in a very competitive industry, but the quick switch from an extremely structured environment to one where you drive the process can have one feeling lonely. In the end though, you are the only one responsible for your career and you have to start providing yourself with motivation and guidance at some point in time. Overall, I can honestly say that I would make the decision to come back to App Academy again. I have learned invaluable skills, and I have a path to a job doing something that I love. There is still a lot of work left to do. I will have to go back and dive deeper into nearly all of the concepts covered in the course. I don\'t believe that most people come out able to get a job the next day, but I would never have made the progress that I did without the rigor and stress that came along with the program. The bootcamp experience is definitely not for everyone. But if you do chose to take this path, I believe that you will find it very rewarding. As others have stated, and in the interest of full disclosure, I am being offered a sweatshirt as motivation for writing a review. I believe everything that I have written, and it is my honest assessment of the program and my experience in it. Best of luck in your search, and in making a life altering decision.

The degree of talent in the room, the relentless work ethic, the shared positivity, and the fun! I\'m very thankful for the lasting... Read More connections I\'ve forged throughout the curriculum.Rewarding projects --&gt; I dare say you\'ll work harder than you\'ve ever worked in your life when approaching your solo / group full-stack projects in the back-half of the curriculum. If you take the projects seriously and approach them as learning experiences, you will 100% grow as a person and as a software developer.Knowledgeable teaching assistants --&gt; I was fortunate to have an extremely knowledgeable and passionate TA as my circle leader; he consistently did a terrific job of reinforcing the learnings from the curriculum and ensuring that we felt prepared heading into our assessments. The rest of the TAs, some more experienced than others, did a fine job of designing/delivering our daily lectures as well as helping us all out on the floor each afternoon while we tackled our pair-programming assignments. CONS:Absence of Feedback --&gt; As a new student, you\'ll be required to provide daily feedback on a variety of topics: quality of the curriculum, how well your pair-programming experiences go, your satisfaction level related to the support of your TAs, etc... and yet (to my knowledge) none of us ever received a single piece of feedback in return. I was very vocal about my desire for someone with experience to review my code or even my progress at any point in the curriculum... sadly, this did not come to fruition. If I\'m honest, App Academy did not faithfully deliver on the expectations it set regarding the amount of support we would receive throughout the program. There were times when I was either seriously concerned about my own performance or extremely frustrated with aspects of the curriculum, but no one representing the program ever extended an opportunity to have a conversation about this. Excessive emphasis on passing assessments --&gt; Expect to take tests constantly (at least 1x / week for the first six weeks, not including practice exams). As of this moment, if you fail more than 2 exams, you risk getting dismissed from the program. The pressure was extremely high for almost all of us leading up to the assessments; we were concerned for ourselves and the possibility of losing the friends that we became close with. While I don\'t have a problem with designing a system to ensure that students are keeping up with the course material, I do seriously question each test\'s ability to accurately (or even roughly) gauge a student\'s understanding of the material. In hindsight, it felt like a lot of success was derived from a combination of memorizing code and test-taking strategies that were aimed to prioritize passing unit tests (i.e. scoring points) over genuine understanding of the course material... this last point being especially frustrating because it lies in direct contrast to App Academy\'s emphasis on prioritizing understanding over finishing assignments / projects. Poorly designed online educational materials --&gt; Over time, I found myself increasingly frustrated by the quality of App Academy\'s online educational materials. As a full-time in-person student, you will rely on this online program to supplement the daily lectures and help you complete the daily homework assignments. As a visual / tactile learner, I have no problem admitting that I regularly found myself completely discouraged by App Academy\'s approach to online learning: giant blocks of dense (often highly technical) text, static (non-interactive) code-snippets, poorly edited videos with outdated material, UI that lacks search functionality, etc... and you\'ll frequently find topics that App Academy decides to send you elsewhere on the Internet to learn about. HTML / CSS education needs (a lot of ) love --&gt; I would not recommend App Academy\'s HTML / CSS education above any of the most well-known and freely available resources on the internet. The curriculum peppers in bite-size doses of these topics with several half-hour projects &amp; only 1 lecture entirely devoted to CSS. Almost all of us reached intermediate levels of competency in these topics exclusively through self-learning while working on our full-stack projects.Insufficient guidance --&gt; This criticism is specific to the back-half of the curriculum, when you\'ll transition to working on projects and preparing for your inevitable job search. Some examples come to mind: the shortage of TAs to support our cohort and the lack of organization / awareness / preparation regarding project-related lectures &amp; availability of related online resources. I would also recommend regular check-ins between coaches and students in either a small group setting or 1 on 1 (if time permits); the program can often feel like such a whirlwind and the burden is so often laid on the backs of the students to figure things out themselves... I can\'t speak for everyone, but I would feel SO much better at least having the perception that there\'s someone here that is willing to actively guide me instead of just passively being available in the shadows. Final Thoughts:Though this opinion is subject to change once I leave the program and make my way through the job search... despite all my criticisms (no bootcamp is perfect), I have ZERO regrets about enrolling in this program. It challenged me to grow in ways I have never experienced in an academic or professional setting. It gifted me some amazing new friendships and connections that I\'m extremely grateful to walk away with. It\'s worth noting that bootcamps are absolutely not made for everyone... the firehosing of information, the lack of sleep, the pressure, the impostor syndrome... this can often feel like an extremely stressful environment (on your body and your mind)... but if you\'re up for the challenge, this could very well change your life.Read Less','app-academy'),(1425,253056,'Wow.','2019-07-30',0,5,5,5,5,'App academy is great, intense and immersive.

Read More program will ever be perfect. You know the old adage \'you get out what you put in?\' App Academy will absolutely convert your effort into the desired result.One piece of advice that I don\'t think is specific to App Academy: only compare yourself to yourself. I guarantee there will plenty of people who seem smarter or better at everything. Ignore them. Only you know if you\'re putting in the time, if you\'re staying engaged throughout the day, if you\'re holding yourself accountable to be the best that you can be. Do your best and the rest will take care of itself.PROS: - The staff - the TAs (catchall term for instructors) are uniformly knowledgeable and excited to teach. Nearly every lecture was well presented, well communicated, and directly relevant to the material. - The material - the curriculum is rigorous and challenging. Many of the projects that we struggled through in the first weeks will make valuable portfolio additions when we go back and attack them with everything we\'ve learned.  The rhythm for most of the curriculum section is learn material - &gt; assessment -&gt; pivot to new material. This can give you a feeling of whiplash, but what remains constant is the idea that you \'always be learning.\' I feel much better equipped to learn new things in a short period of time than I think I would have had the transitions been more gradual and forgiving. - General culture - For 12 weeks the fellow students in your cohort will be your allies both in learning and life. Nobody else will really understand what it\'s like to go through the program. This might be specific to my cohort, but from what I\'ve seen of other cohorts the sentiment holds true. Beyond that though, the general culture, the interaction between students and students, students and staff, and aA employee culture are all just really positive, really goal oriented and at the same time really forgiving. - Project phase - After the curriculum, you\'ll work on projects. Working on full stack projects was just a fantastic way to tie together all the things we\'d spent the last 8 weeks learning. There is, however, a somewhat stark drop off in how much help you\'ll get from staff from the course curriculum phase to the project phase.CONS: Feedback void - Every day you\'ll be required to give feedback on your partner for the day, and several times throughout the course you\'ll be asked for feedback on the experience as a whole. At no point was I given any indication that my feedback was considered. Several times throughout the course I specifically asked to hear the general sentiment of feedback people were leaving about me, and I got no response (beyond \'yes we can do that\' but then nothing). To be clear, I do believe that feedback I left was at least read by human eyes, but that\'s just a hunch because again, communication was an entirely one way street of me to anonymous form. Further, beyond assessments testing basic functionality of your code, there is no feedback around code style, code smell, or overall code practices. The code we\'re exposed to in the project skeletons and demo is generally good and tightly written, but there\'s no checking to see if any of that has sunk in. I was particularly disappointed by this because on day 1 a TA made a point of saying that aA graduates write more readable, cleaner code than CS graduates, but then there was just no system in place to ensure that.As far as I know no human ever evaluated the quality of my code. Maybe the lesson there is, \'if it works, it works\' but that seems short sighted and not in keeping with the idea of producing quality software developers.I\'m resisting leaving feedback on the job search section because I\'m in the middle of it now. That said, thus far we\'ve covered basic algorithms and data structure in greater depth than we did during the curriculum. We\'ve worked on our resumes, our personal pitch, and what to expect from the whole process. I think I won\'t know the true value of the job search support until some time after the program.PS I did a fair amount of research into various bootcamps before I decided on aA. Obviously my experience is limited to the one I choose, but investigated Hack Reactor, General Assembly, and Berkeley Boot camp in addition to aA.

I didn\'t find that I was spending 90 hours every single week, but the time really begins to add up quickly between the 45-minute commute there, morning lecture time from 9 AM - 12:15 PM, afternoon pair programming from 1:30 PM to 6 PM, another 45-minute commute home, and then any required readings, videos, and homework for the following day\'s material which could often take up to 3 or 4 hours.

As other reviews have mentioned, the assessments are not easy but they are always very fair. It is definitely not subjective in any way and assessments are graded solely based on how many test specs you can get to pass before time runs out.

Jumpstart can help if your background is weak(only couple months), but I certainly noticed an edge for those who did Boot Camp Prep(I didn’t and I was a little envious). So who Am I ? Well I just graduated Today...take my review with respect to that aspect of App Academy’s curriculum. Reviewing them is a little tough because everyone is different, some people pick it up faster(I’m diligent so it’s at what I call a normal pace) and others pick it up faster, but those people which will be in Your cohort have some type of strong technical background most likely. The tests are hard and it is true you can’t tell which one is the hardest normally due to the differences in people. They will overwork you on purpose and try to see if you can pass because if you can’t they want you to fail out. Part of the reason is the last ten days of the main part of the curriculum they let you work on the full stack, but it’s an extremely expensive operation and probably not profitable for them if you can’t do the basics of coding. Not to mention once you start the Full Stack project you need to be able to do it mostly on your own so you can put it on your Resume and say “I did that.” The best part? The Teacher assistants without a doubt. I was actually surprised at home many there are(around six plus the main instructor). The teacher assistants are highly skilled and during the course you will likely learn the most from them more than anything else. When you put it all together App Academy’s program is very good and costs quite a bit of capital to run, remember these teacher assistants are paid well. A couple of last notes. They are now like a well oiled machine. They hire in advance, train the next leaders before they leave, prep the next cohort as soon as you start yours, and they do not stop for whatever reason.....in App academy there are no days off and they work through almost all holidays. If you want to go to App Academy I recommend it. Better if you can pair it with a degree, but standalone it’s good too. If I was you and you were accepted I would not hangout on the weekends. I went to a wedding one day and felt behind the entire course because of it. There’s so much homework that catching up is really hard and the weekends are for studying the tests since it’s pointless to do the homework if you can’t pass the test.

Once you enter the land of JS, the instruction on projects becomes muddled, at times lacking, and is often just flat outdated. I understand that a shift away from Rails to more relevant frameworks and libraries will be a process.

Though I ended up with a job I\'m thrilled with ~2 months after graduation, the following is information I wish I had known going in.... Read MoreApp Academy\'s curriculum is first-class. Though it\'s now freely available online, I found that working through the material in-person with instructor and peer support allowed me to work way harder and learn 100X more effectively than if I had done it on my own. There are a few minor nits to pick with the curriculum (my two cents: not enough vanilla Javascript and React without Redux, too much into to programming stuff), but the staff is incredibly receptive to feedback and changes requested by my cohort are already being implemented in subsequent cohorts. I initially disliked the pair-programming part of the program, but I came around after a few weeks. I do think forcing yourself to communicate your thoughts is the best way to learn and avoid tricking your brain into thinking you know something you don\'t. Though it\'s exhausting to do this all day every day, especially if you\'re an introvert. The rigor of the program is well-documented in other reviews, although I found this pace fun rather than stressful. I devoted ~80 hours a week on average to the program, up to ~100 on intense project weeks. Though controversial, I personally like the assessments as part of the curriculum. I found they kept the pace moving and incentivized learning quite well. Overall, I had an absolute blast during the coding portion of a/A. One thing that\'s critical to note is that most of these reviews were written after completing the coding portion of the curriculum (week 9), but before the job search curriculum (weeks 10-12) or the actual job search. At that point I would have been similarly enthusiastic, but I think most of the negatives of App Academy surface after week 9.The job search curriculum attempted to balance 2 more projects (one with a totally new tech stack), a primer on algorithms and data structures, behavioral preparation, and application materials (resumes etc.). In my opinion, all of these missed the mark. The MERN stack and algorithms projects/lectures were perfunctory and insufficient. The non-technical portions were mainly common sense to anyone who has been through an interview process before (though there are students at a/A who haven\'t, so this material may have been helpful to them). On top of this, all of these disparate pieces were done in parallel, making it impossible to focus on any of them. I think doing them serially would have been far more effective.As difficult as the program is, the job search afterwards is 1000X harder. Though demand for developers is as high as ever, demand for junior developers seems to have taken a nosedive over the past few years. Entry-level dev jobs are hard to come by, and competition for them is fierce due to the high volume of cookie-cutter bootcamp grads out there. App Academy offers guidance on how to navigate this tough market, but it feels like an arms race and I have serious doubts about how long a/A will be able to keep its stats where they are. It\'s also not really accurate to consider this a 12-week program. Though instruction only lasts for 12 weeks, most students will need to spend significant time self-studying (JS and web for frontend, algorithms and data structures for backend and fullstack). In my opinion a/A\'s 12 weeks are plenty sufficient to become a competent junior developer, but the reality of the job market right now is that you will likely have to go well beyond this to get hired, even if you\'re a top performer in the program.A few things I wish I\'d known about placements: The vast majority of App Academy grads end up at startups. Students do get placed at bigger companies occasionally, but this is uncommon. Students with work histories, degrees, and demographics more aligned with industry demand will, in general, have an easier time finding jobs, though counterexamples do exist. Salaries seem to be more or less as advertised. I expected more out of a/A in terms of pipelines and company partnerships - they do have a few (&lt;5) and are working on more, but expect to do almost all of the heavy lifting yourself.Note that many of these issues are not necessarily unique to a/A but are present across the bootcamp industry. Though a/A\'s job search curriculum could use some work and the job search is infinitely more difficult than advertised, I had an absolute blast going through App Academy and ended up with an offer I am thrilled with. I would recommend App Academy to anyone who has the mind for the material and the stomach for the job search.Read Less','app-academy'),(1486,247563,'Best you can expect from a crash course into very difficult material','2019-04-07',0,4.3,4,4,5,'I just graduated from the main curriculum of app academy and am about to enter the job search curriculum.

Read More curriculum is very good and focuses on exactly what you need to know. There are many instances where the program teaches students the under the hood workings of some built in function or program so that you understand the base functionality before moving on to actually using the tools themselves to do the hard part. Essentially, my point is that it\'s very in-depth and the TAs (teaching assistants) are very supportive as well, providing daily lectures and answering any questions students might have as they work on their projects throughout the week. The only complaint I really had was the homework. The homework is optional but it\'s a good idea to do it as often as one can so as to enter the following day with a good grasp of the material that will follow. It is, however, very frustrating, oftentimes with vague directions and few satisfactory results. It\'s very difficult to end a full day of coding with homework on new material that isn\'t always explained very effectively. I personally skipped many days of homework just so I could go to sleep with some peace of mind rather than feeling frustrated and stressed. At the very least, I did always do the readings and videos that were assigned. The other thing I would mention is that this is mostly a learning by doing type of curriculum. Different learning styles aren\'t really taken into account here. There are lectures and readings, but primarily, coding is hands-on material and there\'s no way around that. Students should definitely expect to put in 80 hours a week (including the 45 hours that one must be in attendance) minimum during this bootcamp if they want to succeed. If one puts in the time and devotion for the full 10 weeks, then they will be web developers and they will find a job, plain and simple.

Read More that is enforced.There is a device &amp; attendance strike system (that could lead to dismissal) to make sure people aren\'t being distracted by their phones, laptops, whatever instead of doing their work. This can be a pro or a con depending on your perspective. They WILL dismiss you if you fail 2 of the 6 assessments that happen within the first 5-1/2 weeks. Curriculum topics change every 1 to 1.5 weeks. If you\'re completely new to programming, there isn\'t much time to deeply absorb the topics before moving on to another one.From a materials standpoint, some of the videos, articles, and information that they use is between 3-5 years old. That\'s ancient in the world of tech. At times, the instructions used in pair programming or for the projects (or the homework) can be vague &amp; unintentionally (or intentionally?) misleading. Often times I was frustrated by how little focus the work presented seemed to have.There were a few times where it felt less like inspiration/motivation and more like scare-tactics were used to get people to do their work. The assessments carry so much weight that a few of my classmates failed because they freaked out during the test and couldn\'t recover. The instructors tell you to make sure you sleep, take care of yourself, etc. But then there\'s a timed assessment that basically dictates your future looming over your head. And every day is regimented, scheduled, lectured and pre-determined for you, that there isn\'t time to catch up from anything in the previous days.This all may sound scary, and intimidating or more like a military boot camp, than a coding one (I sometimes wonder if that\'s really what they\'re going for), but after the assessments are done, and the weight of dismissal has been lifted, things start to make sense. Around Week 7/8 is when you start to build your fullstack project. For me at least, this is where all the pieces began to come together. Each of the topics that we learned finally had a place, and while you still don\'t know everything about any of it all, you have at least a base understanding that you can build from. You can start to ask questions about where to begin, where to go, what you want to do, etc.To be clear, the level of knowledge that you gain once the first 9 weeks are done WILL allow you to build a fullstack, fully working app. Will it be the next Facebook, Google, Instagram or Snapchat? Highly unlikely, but you now have a solid foundation that could possibly get you there.All in all, my outlook on the program is that I didn\'t much care for certain portions of it while going through it, but I am thankful for being shown the frustrations, intricacies and the BS that comes with web development. As they say, what doesn\'t dismiss you from bootcamp, only makes you a stronger software dev (or something like that ;-) ).So to conclude, this school isn\'t for everyone, it doesn\'t need to be. If you thrive in pressure or at least know yourself well enough to be able to work through intense situations, then this may be for you. Just know that it\'s not going to be pretty. It\'s not going to be easy.

They really want each student to succeed and will make sure to get them the help they need.- Friendly and safe environment as well as inclusive- Admissions process really brings in people who are very well-rounded and have absolute determination to succeed (and to get in job in the end) - I was surrounded by people who I thought was much smarter than me and hardworking which caused me to push myself to improve everyday- Curriculum includes a ton of hands on learning - projects everyday to make you apply new concepts directly to code- Ton of pair programming - a lot of opportunities to collaborate with other programmers and learn other techniques/methodsCons:- Some material/projects(not too many) of the curriculum were not very clear - the instructions were difficult to understand which obstructed my ability to get far in those projects during those days- Ton of pair programming - as mentioned above, it\'s a great aspect, but sometimes it becomes too much - dense material can be difficult to understand in a few days and I personally found it beneficial when we had some solo programming days to really struggle through the day\'s projects on our ownOverall, this was a great experience for me and I definitely recommend this course!Read Less','app-academy'),(1547,244878,'The most intense career challenge of my life, but rewarding','2018-12-22',0,4.3,4,4,5,'Amazing organization.

This is the main advantage of the bootcamp opposed to trying to learn the material on your own. The curriculum is good in this sense, but don\'t expect to learn everything or even cover everything that a junior developer should know. The curriculum is intensive, but introductory. Think of the curriculum as a spring-board for learning more on your own outside of working hours and after the conclusion of the program. The TAs / instructors are also what make the program worth it. They are invested in helping you and making sure that you understand the material. That being said, you must study, or you will fall behind and get kicked out. This means putting in a lot of hours and letting the curriculum consume you. Even then, you must study hard &amp; study smart. Long hours of work doesn\'t guarantee mastery, so learn how to study before you show up.The people you work with will be awesome. Your peers are usually quite driven and all on the same career path as you. This being said, you will have to learn how to work with different people with different personalities. Be the kind of person you would want to work with. Since the foundation of the first 7 weeks is pair-programming, this program is not for people that cannot interact well with others. The classroom environment is not the greatest. You sit on a crowded floor at long tables (full of mac minis) coding all day with a partner. The chairs are terrible and you will start to feel it if you don\'t get up often. The lecture hall consists of 50+ folding chairs that also feel terrible (especially after 3 hours of lecture). Don\'t fall for the nice looking banner pictures on the website that portray these hipsters drinking coffee in lounging couches while coding. That\'s not what this program is, that is just clever marketing. I highly suggest, that anyone interested in attending A/A come visit the work sites. It is not a deal breaker, but you should have an accurate view of the place you will be spending the next 3 months. Lastly, if your finances permit, don\'t take the deferred payment option. Be motivated, do well, and pay upfront. The huge caveat is that you need to do well and not get kicked out. If you have more questions about this, then just do the math between the two plans, and ask questions. Don\'t just blindly sign an agreement until you understand everything.Overall, I have been enjoying the program, however, I don\'t think that this program is for everyone.

First, they say that they care about your ergonomic health, but this is not true in the slightest. They have no options for better keyboards or mice, no monitors at eye level, horrible chairs. This may get better in the future based on some of the conversations I had, but I wouldn\'t count on it. Cohorts are in and out of there in 9 weeks so there is little incentive to actually make the working conditions better. The other area of disappointment was the availability of the instructors. There is this question button you can hit to have an instructor come over to you, but I waited upwards of 45 minutes in some situations.On the other side of that though, you do need to be self-sufficient and be able to find the answer on your own sometimes.

Lastly, the price seems very steep, but I find it to be worth it in terms of the value comparison of a college education.

I wanted to wait until I actually got an offer, so here it is.If you\'re looking at this review, you\'re probably looking to make a career-change or gain an edge... Read More in landing that first software development role after graduating University (or High School?). For me, it was absolutely worth it.1. This is one of the only coding bootcamps which hold you to a certain learning-pace with weekly assessments for the first 8-ish weeks. If you fall behind and fail two of them, you\'re out of the program, and trust me this will take a lot of work to pass. It ensures that you actually learned the material and can do the basics, but the pace of this program isn\'t for everyone. You will wake up in the morning, get to the office, code all day, go home, work on HW assignments, code some more, sleep, then repeat for 3 months. You will literally live/eat/breathe code for the duration and you\'ll learn so much, but this brings up my second point.2. You will have no life during the program. When people say this in the reviews, they\'re not being excessive. I almost had a panic attack on the night before my first assessment (Sunday) because I was struggling with some concepts. You will learn a new concept and then be expected to pass an assessment on it the following week, while already learning new material. Tell your friends/girlfriend/family/dog that you\'ll pay attention to them after 3 months. (For reference, my cohort had like 20% of the cohort drop out... This isn\'t a joke)3. You will meet some of the most brilliant people you\'ve ever met in your cohort. We\'ve had Ivy-League grads, WallStreet guys, Entrepreneurs, Musicians, Basement gamers who want to finally get a job, etc... They were from all different backgrounds, but almost every single one of them were brilliant in their own way. I actually felt dumb for the first time in my life. Being surrounded by these people and pair-programming with each of them every single day will help you learn and see code in a different way. You\'ll also learn how to deal with not-so-favorable people, which will help you during your actual job (stubborn/argumentative people, keyboard hogs, etc), but these interactions are rare.4. The Job-Search support is actually one of the best parts of this curriculum. Technical and Non-Technical interviewing is a skill just like programming, and you\'ll gain a ton of practice white boarding and talking about yourself/background. My career coach was the best hype-man I could\'ve ever asked for, and I think he actually helped me ultimately land my first role.If you put in the work, and you pass all the assessments, you\'ll land a job. A vast majority of my cohort all landed jobs within the first 6-months after program completion.The most important part is putting in the work after you actually finish the program (Job-Search is honestly the hardest part because there\'s minimal hand holding and you\'re actually competing for roles against other people who often have CS degrees). There\'s no time for an extended break after completing the program. Start working on more features on your fullstack project, start learning data structures / algorithms more in depth, white board at least once a week, etc... It will take a lot of work. The best part is that you have access to the office at all times, so you can go in to work while you look for a job even after you complete the program.For me, this program changed my life and I\'m thankful I went through it.Lastly, I want to share one tip: Before you start the program, you absolutely should complete a beginner\'s web-development course on freecodecamp or Udemy.

I wish they had more experienced TA\'s with CS backgrounds who deeply understood the material- Some people were far worse than others in the cohort an they sucked up lots of the instruction time, I felt TA\'s could have done a better job of prioritizing assistance- They teach Ruby (which is a dying language) and JS, when they really should be teaching Python and JS- Career coaches can come off as job application enforcers, and mine didn\'t help me get my foot in any door, he just tried to give me advice which was occasionally helpful- 5/10k is a lot of money to lose if you fail the cohort, that\'s takes a real mental toll to try to study when you have that much money on the line- Working 90-100 hours a week for 2.5 months was emotionally draining and I usually could only take 2 hours or so off per weekAdditional Thoughts:After searching for jobs for 2 months, I realized that Python would have been far better to learn than Ruby. Everyone uses it basically. Other bootcamps probably teach Python and JS and that might make the job search easier. I like Ruby, but I find it hard to recommend the program because of the decision to teach Ruby and not Python. The cost is fairly high, and so it is hard to enroll in a/A without some money in the bank. It ends up being a sort of accelerator for already privileged people, which is not what they necessarily advertise. This is just how it is unfortunately. Also the advertisements are inaccurate because most people don\'t get jobs at Google unless they were TA\'s at a/A for some time. Another thing is that a/A is somewhat of a revolving door, I am noticing that the best instructors leave almost as soon as they become fully capable instructors. This might lead to lower quality instruction. a/A doesn\'t have good organization as a company and people working for them complain about things like not getting paid and constant misunderstandings. I would never go through something like this again, but I can\'t deny that it worked for me and most of my cohort. About 50% of us landed jobs, and fast. However, a few of the other 50% of students were able to get through but some of them mysteriously seem like they still don\'t understand coding, and were able to get through by just memorizing practice assessments. I think this set of people is might struggle for a long time and maybe give up. The weeding out is not as intense as it should be. a/A was scary and intense but it imposes immense focus on you that allows you to surpass your previous ignorance and gain serious skills that make you employable, and eventually well paid.

You are exposed to the topics you learn 3-4 times, like the readings, homework, lecture, and daily projects, and so although the pace is fast, you pick up on them soon just by repeated exposure.

Teaching competency of instructors varies – some are excellent, some are mediocre – but honestly it\'s probably as good as you can expect from any coding bootcamp. Instructor support overall is very good. Everything you need for a solid foundation to begin the cohort is provided throughout the application process; what\'s key is setting aside enough time to properly absorb the material (at least two months prior to interviewing, a month between the first and last interview, and a month between admission and cohort start time). The provided prep material is time intensive in its own right, and most who struggle to keep up didn\'t spend enough time preparing. Time to catch up after beginning the cohort is almost non-existent. What makes aA stand out: - Rigid structure of accountability through roll calls, assignments, and assessments. Like having a good physical trainer, you may often hate the diet and the workouts in the moment, but in the long run you\'ll be surprised how much you progress.  - Constant pair programming and collaborative work. Especially taxing for introverts, but enormously helpful in learning how to communicate effectively. A significant advantage over solo/remote study options, and even most university curricula. - Outstanding job search curriculum. Lots of very helpful workshops, application prep, and interview practice. Can you learn everything taught in a bootcamp on your own? Almost certainly. What you\'re paying for is the opportunity to learn it faster, make connections with other students/instructors, and receive solid career coaching.

Overall, you will learn Ruby, SQL, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux. You won\'t get much practice on HTML/CSS, until you get to your full stacks in week 8, where you put everything together to clone a website. For the first 7 weeks, the daily routine is basically HTML/CSS in the morning, lecture until about lunch time, then pair programming the rest of the day. The last 30 minutes are spent with your circle discussing your day. The evenings are spent on reading and watching videos on tomorrow\'s material and usually accompanied with basic exercises. The readings and videos will take a decent chunk of your time, so I suggest doing them ahead of time if you can. There are 6 assessments throughout the course. They tell you almost exactly what is going to be on the assessment, they give you a practice assessment, they give you a test generator to time yourself, they give you a video of a TA going through the practice assessment. Basically you shouldn\'t feel lost when studying up for the assessment. All the resources are there for you. When full stacks arrive on week 8, things change. No more lectures, no more circle time, and no more readings and videos. You work on your full stack all day, helping each other out when you hit bugs, giving tips to others who are doing the same or similar websites.Some constructive criticism. The lectures, especially toward the end of the curriculum, were particularly long, and most of it was very similar to our homework that we already completed the previous night. I honestly only found those lectures useful for asking questions, but I did not feel the need to spend 2-3 more hours on the same topic we already spent hours learning for homework. The instructions for the daily projects are outstanding, providing step-by-step instructions on what you need to do next and why, that is up until around the end of week 6. Often times there will be a bulleted-list of directions telling you to implement so-and-so, when before these bulleted-list of directions would each have their own paragraph, supplemented with code snippets and explanations. In the React projects especially, they would tell you to implement something, and a few lines later, they\'d provide the exact code you should write. I don\'t think that is helpful to our understanding. Some TAs are older and more experienced, others are recent graduates of App Academy themselves. Some are clearly better at explaining, while some kind of just look at the solutions and tell you to write what the solutions did. I\'m thankful they are all trying and willing to help, but I\'d always hope for certain TAs over others when hitting that Ask a question button.All in all, it was a very rewarding experience.

Knowing that everyone else in your cohort is going through the exact same thing is reassuring, that everyone else is sleep-deprived and feeling exhausted all the time, that if you ran into a bug that someone else will most likely have also ran into the same bug, that you have others who also committed the next 9 weeks to change their life. I\'ve learned more at App Academy and produced more projects that I am proud of than I did in 4 years in college as a Computer Science major.

Read More through interviewing and accepted a job as a software engineer (have been working for 1 month now). I think very favorably of the program overall, but want to provide some quick bullets to answer questions that I know I had when considering if App Academy was right for me:1. How long does it take to get a job after finishing the program? - I feel very fortunate in that I was connected with a company with an App Academy alum at my graduation night (the final week of the program) and wrapped up my interview cycle with them in 2 weeks. This is not the norm, though. Expect your search on average to take anywhere from 4-9 months.2. What is the average starting salary? - My offer was just shy of $100k at a company in New York City. Friends of mine from App Academy who have gotten jobs in the past few weeks have all been offered slightly more than me, but I hear the average range is closer to $85-90k for App Academy graduates in the New York area.3. What are the payment plan options? - There are 3 choices: (1 - upfront) $17k all up front, (2 - hybrid) $9k up front and $14k in scheduled payments after accepting a job, and (3 - deferred) $5k upfront and $23k in payments after accepting a job. For #s 2 and 3, how you pay off the larger second amount depends on your starting salary; if you sign the alumni engagement agreement (you agree to mentor future students and show up at a/A events), your tuition will be capped at either 23% (hybrid) or 28% (deferred) of your starting salary and you\'ll pay the lower of that amount or the written amount that you owe. For example, if you accept a starting salary of $85k and you have chosen the hybrid plan, you\'d only have to pay $10.55k back instead of the full $14k. Your payment schedule depends on your starting salary as well, but expect to pay between $1500 and $2000 monthly until you\'ve paid back what you owe. If you don\'t accept a job after a year from when the program ends and you\'ve been looking with a good faith effort, you get your money back. 4. Does App Academy force me to take the first job I get? - No. You can choose to turn down offers that don\'t make sense for you, but I\'m pretty sure if you do that and don\'t accept a job by the time the year after your program ends, you\'re still on the hook for tuition since you technically did get a job offer.5. Will I feel prepared to join the workforce as a software engineer when the program is up?- Imposter syndrome will tell you no, and that\'s not totally wrong. There is still so much that I want to learn about software development where I feel like I\'m currently just scratching the surface. But, I do feel qualified for my current job. App Academy did a great job of teaching me both the fundamentals and how to learn things quickly that I don\'t know (Google is your friend! All developers, bootcamp or not, use it daily!). There\'s been nothing I\'ve encountered at my job so far that I\'ve had no idea how to handle.6. Who are the instructors?- The instructors are former App Academy students that most times are hired while they are still students, so they know the material very well but have not yet worked as developers outside of App Academy. The curriculum is developed by lead TAs who take the job very seriously and travel to conferences/attend meetups to make sure it is up-to-date and relevant.7. Who will my classmates be?- Students seem to vary in their backgrounds. Expect a cohort in NYC to be around 40 people though, and maybe 5 of them will have a CS degree. Closer to 1/3 might have previous light coding experience (SQL, basic JavaScript) from another job. 8. What languages will I learn and are they useful in the job market?- App Academy will teach you Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS as languages. More specifically, you\'ll learn Rails as a backend framework and React/Redux as frontend libraries to help you render web pages. Ruby is not used heavily anymore but is a great semantic starter language to help teach you how to code. React, from what I\'ve seen, is where job demand is right now. My current team uses React.9. Is it really possible to be successful in this program with no coding background?- Yes. I had no coding background. That being said though, it takes a lot of work and determination to get up to speed. I did the JumpStart program through a/A which taught me coding basics for free after work over 4 weeks. Then once I was accepted, I meticulously when through the pre-cohort prep course (alpha course) before beginning classes. Take alpha seriously and make sure you understand it thoroughly; there\'s office hours for your questions.10. Cons?- It\'s a stressful environment where you can fail out if you don\'t pass 2 of the weekly exams. There are only 6 exams total so they don\'t last for your whole time in the program, but they are very high stress and require a strong ability to focus and mitigate any anxiety that this may induce for you. The prep resources are there to help you (there are always practice exams for you to take and TAs will occasionally have test walk-throughs to attend before the assessments) but you need to put the work in to succeed. My one complaint about App Academy is there is still room for improvement for how TA\'s provide emotional support to students who do not handle stress well. If that is you, you can still do this program - don\'t be discouraged! But you will have to go out of your way to ask for emotional support and feedback from your TAs and peers.Read Less','app-academy'),(1631,244590,'Your life will change','2018-08-19',0,5,5,5,5,'Your life will change (super cliché/corny, I know, but it’s kind of true) after finishing this program.

Read More as it could be, and you’re going to run into a lot of frustration with realizing that the things you need to learn to do some of the exercises are covered in later chapters or that in the later chapters. I recommend going out of your way to look up your own documentation of the concepts introduced in the Alpha Course Curriculum. Chris Pine’s Intro to Ruby free online course helped me a lot in that regard, you can google it but I believe App Academy should have also linked you to that resource. The program is intense, even for people with cs degrees. People with background will definitely catch up concepts faster and some will be a review for them. But it doesn\'t mean its not hard for them. As a someone without tech background, came to aA everyday including weekends to study. They are not lying about 100 hours per week of studing time. for the first 9 weeks, I\'ve never slept more than 6 hours. This is my personal case, some people can study only 70~80 hours and still do super well. This program is NOT for everyone. You really have to be passionate to learn how to program. Even if you are, this style of learning may not be for you. I personally loved it and enjoyed every moment of it. I strongly recommend to everyone, but please take everyone\'s warning very seriously.

We\'ve learned Ruby, SQL, Javascript, React, Redux,... Read More Rails, and completed a full-stack clone of an existing application. There are people of all ages and backgrounds here. The youngest being 17 (by a pretty wide margin), and the oldest 40+. There are quite a few CS majors, but also people with engineering, accounting, sales, etc. backgrounds. However, the gender ratio for this cohort was pretty bad: about 1/12 are female. There are definitely people who are a lot better at coding from the start than others, which may change over the course of the program, so be prepared for that.In my opinion, these are the two most incredible parts of a/A:1. How much you learn, and how fast you learn it. The workload is intense (see below), but you\'ll amaze yourself with how capable you are of absorbing it! 2. The people. The TA\'s are very intelligent and genuinely want to help you succeed. The culture is not competitive at all. Everyone supports each other. We help one another with bugs, explain concepts to those who are struggling, get lunch together, and generally have a good time while coding. This community is actually very important, especially considering that we spend at least 45 hours together/week.When you apply and pass the interviewing process, you must complete an Alpha Course — essentially a pretty packed curriculum on the basics of Ruby and Object Oriented Programming. a/A recommends that you spend 4 weeks on this, which is definitely a good idea. However, completely it in less than that time is doable if you can fully commit all your time to doing it. I finished in less than 2 weeks, although I had some prior programming experience in Java. I also spent nearly the entirety of every day working on it. Each day during the first section of the actual course looked pretty much the same, save the material we learned that day: 9am start, lecture for around 2 hours, then pair program for the rest of the day to practice the material taught in lecture, with a break for lunch and a brief one in the afternoon. After the school day is over, we do 1-3 hours of homework. The homework consists of readings/videos and a small assignment that cover the material for the next day, which will be reviewed during the lecture. This is why a/A is definitely a full-time commitment — really try to keep up, and this is totally doable if you are sufficiently motivated and allocate your time wisely. At first, it was pretty difficult to adjust to this schedule: my eyes would be really sore by Thursday of each week for the first 3 weeks, and there are no windows so it\'s a little stifling. However, by the end of that, I was fully adapted.There are a total of 6 assessments spread across the first 8 weeks, and if you fail twice, and then fail a retake, you are kicked out, no exceptions. This is a really strict policy, and it\'s definitely a lot of pressure. About 25% of the people in my cohort were kicked out, so please consider this carefully. I failed the third assessment, and was really stressed for the rest, but passed them without a problem. These assessments really are not designed to get you or anything like that. They provide practice assessments, and as long as you do those until you can finish it in about half the time you get for the real assessment, you will be totally fine. Just make sure you understand the material — don\'t simply memorize! Overall, an amazing experience, and I would definitely do it again given the choice.Read Less','app-academy'),(1634,236264,'App Academy Review','2018-08-18',0,5,5,5,5,'Attending App Academy has been one of the most rewarding experiences I\'ve had.

I\'ll just talk about the experience I have to this point. The way the curriculum works is that you have 9 weeks of the learning curriculum. You learn Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React,... Read More Redux, SQL, and more. You also create your full-stack project.The next 3 weeks is the career curriculum. Here they teach you what you need to do to get a job, and what you should expect. During this time, you create a javascript project.First off let me say, it is a difficult program. When they say 100 hours/week, it\'s literally 100 hours per week. It is a pretty hard thing to get used to. Also, during the first 9 weeks, there are 6 assessments that you have to pass. If you don\'t pass 2, your out. So kind of harsh. However, at the end of it, it\'s a really accomplished feeling.I would recommend planning on not having a life for the 3 months you are in the program. We had really great TA\'s to teach us the curriculum and help us with all our questions. The support that they give is really great! It\'s crazy how much you can learn in just 12 weeks!At the end of the 12 weeks, you have 2-3 projects, a personal website, a resume, linkedin profile etc etc. They make sure you have everything in order for you to get a job.I just graduated so I don\'t know if how prepared we are, but all in all, it was a great experience.Read Less','app-academy'),(1636,232161,'Amazing, but nowhere near perfect','2018-08-10',0,4.7,4,5,5,'You know when you were a kid and you kind of thought your parents or grown ups had everything figured out?

Read More and thought it was about as good as one could do trying to teach this amount of material in a very condensed period of time. But I don\'t think aA should remain complacent because there is definitely room for improvement. For instance, when you first arrive, you learn a bit about the TAs, some of whom may have just graduated from aA the week before. This isn\'t inherently a bad thing, but you do see a big disparity between TAs who have more experience and those that are hot off the presses for lack of a better term. This becomes more obvious the more you ask about topics that are tangentially related to the curriculum. I think the TAs on average tend to nail topics related to every day\'s projects, but if you\'re looking for a resource to widen your understanding of some technologies you may find yourself slightly disappointed depending on who you ask. The next element I took issue with is the check-in structure. I want to emphasize this: bootcamp students are adult humans. App Academy has a thrice daily check-in (by 9, 1:10-1:130, 3:55-4:00) that must be done on their internet to confirm that you\'re there. On one hand--I get it because we do pair programming for most of the day and missing out on the pairing screws over your partner for the day. On the other hand, we don\'t need to be treated like elementary school students and should be given at least a LITTLE more license over our education. This isn\'t likely to change anytime soon, so if it seems overbearing to you, keep that in mind.Assessments. The assessments are necessary but flawed... one one hand, you need to make sure students are really keeping up with their understanding of the material because if you don\'t understand each week or day\'s subject matter, you\'re setting yourself up for failure in the coming weeks. That said, the assessments aren\'t so dynamic that you can\'t just read the specs, learn the patterns, and pass the assessments without fundamentally understanding the core concepts. All this is to say that students that don\'t have a great understanding of the material can sneak through the system by memorizing patterns needed for assessments. I think they could stand to be recalibrated.The curriculum is excellent but the project instructions vary pretty drastically from day to day. Some days the projects feel clear as day and the instructions step through the material in a way that puts you and your partner in the driver\'s seat giving you the appropriate amount of hints/code. Other days the instructions feel really really open ended and make far too many assumptions about our prior knowledge. I could continue to nitpick details about App Academy, but at the end of the day, the students are bright, motivated, and the environment is extremely positive and supportive. While the work load at times can feel overwhelming, the TAs and your fellow students are always there to help. I would recommend App Academy to just about anybody looking to quickly get from 0 to 100 as a web developer and I would encourage aA to never stop improving.Read Less','app-academy'),(1637,232130,'Most intense 3 months of my life','2018-08-10',0,5,5,5,5,'Imagine having maybe a couple hours a day to sleep to take a break and sleep for maybe 7-8 hours and working for the rest of the time.

Once you are familiar with how web-development works, you realize that there are similar patterns/conventions that are fundamental to each language. Different programming languages can all achieve the same means.- Make sure you enroll ahead of the months notice that they tell you to. You do have pre-curriculum prep that you have to do before the cohort that requires at least two weeks of time. I personally went through the prep work twice before my cohort started as well as learning as much JavaScript as I could. This goes a long way between determining how stressed you feel during the lecture part of the curriculum when you\'re learning new materials everyday.- I did a good amount of problems on CodeWars and CodeFights and LeetCode during my preparation for the application.

Read More knowledge you accrue throughout the curriculum period is crazy. One of the aspects that I really liked at app academy was just being able to surround yourself around incredibly talented individuals, who are all working towards the same goal as you. It really fosters an environment that allows you to push yourself further.A typical day at App Academy during the curriculum period consists of checking in at 9am, lecture, pair programming, and flex time, which is pretty much a circle time where you discuss with your designated group about what you learned that day. Some of the TAs were previous students and were very approachable, though at times during pair programming, none are on the floor/available. There are lecture videos and homework you are tasked to watch and complete every night, which usually take a few hours to complete. Assessments are given almost every week during the curriculum period and they require tons of studying. Be prepared to simply eat, sleep, code, repeat.

Read More of time, I probably learned more than a year\'s worth of self studying. For the first 8 weeks, you are going to be going to a/A and getting a lecture in the morning and then coding until 5:30PM with some exceptions. After that, you will have homework, which includes assignments, readings, videos, which generally take about 1-3 hours in the earlier weeks and going up to 5 hours as you progress through the course.You spend your first 2-3 weeks, going over Ruby to practice/learn coding fundamentals. The next 3 weeks are spent learning SQL and Ruby on Rails, where you can create your first website! After creating your website, you learn JavaScript for about a week and then React/Redux to learn how to improve your website. I honestly wish more time was spent on the JavaScript portion of the curriculum, but at this point everything is moving along even faster. You spend weeks 8-9 creating a clone of a website like Instagram, SoundCloud, Facebook ect. This is probably the first time where you are actually building a project from scratch to finish and its great once you accomplished it! However up until you finish, it will most likely be a struggle and a big learning experience.After that is done, you get to move to the job search portion, where you build another solo project and a group project of your choice, which was also pretty fun/struggle! During this time you also learn and work on skills not related to coding such as resumes, cover letters, salary negotiations. After that you have around two weeks to work on learning algorithms, which are key to getting a job. You pretty much self learn/have limited help during this time and you basically set your own schedule more or less.Overall App Academy is great for getting introducing you to being a software developer. You should be fine if you put in the work. The assessments you take are similar to the practice ones they give you.

The class meets for two and a half hours a day, five days a week for four weeks. Expect to start the first day with a two and half hour lecture. Overall the course was very well paced and clearly delivers coding foundations and basics. I made the mistake of falling behind which led the first two weeks being very challenging. Assignments are given out every day so prepare to spend extra time outside of class (1 to 2hrs/day) coding and learning. Lesson notes are provided as text as well as video walk through which was VERY helpful. You can also ask the instructors for help if needed, they were always available after class. As far as learning enough to get accepted into a top bootcamp: the class offers a money back guaranteed so you really can’t lose out. I do feel that graduated who spend time practicing after the course will have a very good shot at making it into top bootcamps. INSTRUCTORS / NON-TECHNICAL BENEFITSThis was what made the class worth it for me. Usually when you talk to someone (especially an instructor that works for a bootcamp) you’ll notice they’re trying to sell you something. That wasn’t the case here.

Again, 2 chances to pass part 1 (which I already had) or part 2. I didn\'t pass either of them, although it was close. Then I was told there was one more opportunity at a remote technical interview via Skype, which I jumped at, and finally passed. Then, one more non-technical fit interview which was just like a normal job interview, and then I was in.ONCE YOU\'RE INThere is a lot of front loaded information before you even start your first day. It\'s called the Alpha Curriculum. It goes over Ruby basics, helps you get your machine environment setup, and you build little projects to prepare you. Near the end you build something like Battleship and I think it runs in the terminal. Takes about 100 total hours to complete the Alpha Curriculum.DAY TO DAY EXPERIENCEFor the first 8 weeks, you\'re paired with someone to program with. All day, every day. You switch driving and navigating roles every 15 minutes. One of you is meant to guide the direction of the code, and the other to implement it. There is a strike system in place meant to keep you present and on task, 10 strikes and you\'re dismissed from App Academy. There are also 6 assessments that you need to pass. If you fail twice, you\'re also dismissed (you get a single retry on your second fail). It seems harsh, but the content you learn builds heavily on previous content.How a normal week day looks:1-3 hours of lecture5-7 hours of pair programming1 hour lunch2-4 hours of homework (consisting of reading, videos - shorter if you watch on 2x speed, coding exercises)How a weekend looks:12-20 hours of preparation for assessments. Usually a sample assessment is released, which you are expected to grind over during the weekend, in addition to 2-3 hours of homework for Monday.WHAT YOU LEARNBasically you\'re learning web technologies. Ruby and Rails for the backend, JavaScript, React, and Redux for the frontend. After 8 weeks of pair programming is complete, you start your first stack project, and complete it in 10 days. For example, this was mine: https://infinotes.herokuapp.com/After the full stack project, there is a JavaScript project, and lastly a flex project that you\'re expected to complete with a team.

The instructor, Alvin, and his TA, David, were by far the best people anyone could ask for when it came to teaching the class. Alvin responds to emails usually in less than one hour (if I message him on Slack, far quicker of course), and the way he teaches, there is no way someone can fall behind. Each line of code is explained in bitter detail until everyone has a positive look on their face.Material : VIDEO WALKTHROUGHS. for every single problem on the homework or assessment, Alvin made videos walking through each one. I now have access to those walkthroughs for life on Github. If you are new to coding, these walkthroughs are your lifeblood. You can easily learn everything you need to know without stepping foot in a classroom if you have a good walkthrough for a problem set. These walkthroughs are thorough, and I used them for interview prep extensively. Competition: I was lucky(un-lucky) enough to have some extra cash to spend to seal the deal on nailing the technical interviews. I decided to enroll in Hack Reactor\'s prep course. I chose the premium prep option in which I was given a mentor who would design a curriculum based on my level of knowledge. I really just wanted technical interview questions so I could review them with my mentor. When I signed up, I knew fairly quickly this wasn\'t going to be App Academy. In order to get answers to questions as a premium prepper, I had to submit it in a certain format on a certain site, etc. When you have a question to a problem, the last thing you want is to have to go through the process of submitting it for review (and waiting 24-48 hours). The course itself was actually free, so i actually only paid for the submission of the code.My mentor, who was already uncomfortable with me just wanting to do the technical interview prep, wanted me initially to start off at ground 0 learning what a variable was. After a prickly conversation, I moved on to a video session with him. Very knowledgeable guy, I just probably wouldn\'t put him as the mentor to receive people at first. I asked for a refund, and received one very quickly from the very nice people there. I think Hack Reactor is a strong tiered school, but their bootcamp prep approach differs from App Academy. I can promise you, as a ground 0 student, pay the extra money and go to a/A. This is not the only experience. My business partner left his job at the same time as I did, and enrolled in Galvanize Bootcamp Prep. Galvanize has a course in which they don\'t even give you solutions to problems! He quickly had to leave because there were no problem reviews, and the instructor had never done the problems himself. I kid you not, he refused to answer how to do an isEven function, and instead said to think about how to do it. You will never pass a technical interview with not repeatedly doing problems.Conclusion : I can\'t speak to full bootcamps, the other camps I mentioned have extremely strong track records of success at their full camps, and I would be lucky to get into their immersive programs.

Before I got accepted into the actual program I spent about 2 months preparing by learning ruby, in part with their JumpStart program, which I strongly suggest if they ask you to join - it\'s free compared to the Bootcamp Prep, but isn\'t as in-depth from what I hear. Take the AlphaCourse really seriously - don\'t approach it with the attitude of it only takes x hours to finish, I\'ll wait until x hours before it\'s due! because that\'s the mentality that gets you failing out of the program.The curriculum has been worked over by a lot of people and on the whole is very solid and thorough, but at times can be hard to follow if you don\'t understand the style it is being conveyed to you in. That said, after 9 weeks of the curriculum, I made a fully functioning, albeit slightly bare-bones, website which completely blew my mind to see the progress I made. This accomplishment is just as much due to my own abilities as it is to the curriculum, institution, and the teachers they employe here.10/10 would suggest, but I need at least a solid week of rest following this. Be ready to put in a minimum of 10 hour days and 60 hour weeks - anything less is a fleeting luxury. When you get to the cap-stone project you get 10 days, expect to work those 10 days straight and put a minimum of 100 hours into your project.Read Less','app-academy'),(1686,239786,'A great course for those who are prepared','2018-05-21',0,4.7,4,5,5,'App Academy is a great place to further your knowledge in programming and the curriculum is very rich with information that if you master them, I can say that you\'ll do very well as a web developer.

A lot of people fail out because they didn\'t take it seriously.3. If you really are a true beginner when it comes to coding as in you know nothing, really ask yourself: Do I learn really quickly and if not am I really going to put in the work to make up for that?  I started the program after learning Ruby for 3 weeks, and I can tell you that not having a background in coding really harmed my learning experience at App Academy. I was able to survive the course, but wasn\'t able to absorb as much of the curriculum as I originally intended to. 4. They are not kidding about failing 2 assessments and kicking you out. The assessments are a great way to gauge if you on track but for those who have testing-anxiety a single bug on the examine can mean life or death. I want to say that if you studied enough, then you\'ll do fine but there days when you might not be able to find that bug because it\'s as simple as a spelling typo. Final advice it to just stay on top of your game, assessments are important but don\'t prioritize it over studying for the week\'s material.

Many students take up to 3 months after AA to find a job, and some take as long as 6. You sign an agreement saying you won\'t take on any full-time employment during that time, so make sure you are financially stable enough to commit completely to finding an engineering position.3.

It is a diverse group, but one thing is in common: everyone is pretty passionate about coding and wants to make it. - About prior experience: Some people have asked me if they can attend without coding experience. In my opinion, having prior experience or not is not the deciding factor. The most important thing is making sure that you really want this. People have different learning styles, so think about whether you like a fast-paced environment.- That being said, do consider the potential risk of being dismissed after two failures in assessments. We have 6 assessments in total. In our cohort and previous cohort, the dismiss rate is about 20%. - If you can, try to learn data structures and algorithms before you start aA. In aA, recursion is taught in one day. It is helpful to know basics such as Big O time complexity, sorting algorithms, etc. before you start this program. Two of the assessments are about algorithms (in Ruby and JavaScript).- I also hope I had known more CSS before I came in. CSS is relatively easy to learn on one\'s own, but there are so many details. In aA we don\'t learn a lot about CSS in the curriculum, just because it is not the focus of the curriculum. Core curriculum includes Ruby, Rails, SQL, JavaScript, React/Redux. But you do need to write HTML/CSS in your final projects.- Pair programming: At first I was skeptical, but it turned out to be the best thing about aA. I learned so much from my coding pairs.The job search curriculum starts next week. So I don\'t know yet.Personal story: I considered switching my career path to coding in 2013. But I thought it\'s impossible with my liberal arts background. So I didn\'t give it too much thought and pursued another path. But inevitably I came back to coding. I started to code more in 2016 but still hesitated about whether to apply for developer jobs. When I finally made up my mind it was kind of late. But better late than never... I am grateful for being able to make that decision. No matter the results, had to try. I think you don\'t have to attend a bootcamp. Just don\'t give up easily. Try to learn programming for several months and see if you enjoy it. If not, that\'s fine.

However, the coding challenges to get accepted in the bootcamp are not trivial. They will require some basic knowledge of a programming language.

It is very important to do and complete the Alpha Course before the start of the curriculum. Ninja advice, the Alpha Course will prep you well for the first two weeks, but you have to keep learning at a fast pace. You will not be doing just Ruby (the first language taught in App Academy) . If you have extra time before starting App Academy, my advice is to read up and look at some code for SQL and Ruby on Rails. This will smooth your transition from simple object oriented programming in the first two weeks to the first real web development process, backend development and database management.

So beyond the normal stress that this amount of work induces, there\'s not really much or any time to take care of yourself by going the gym, hanging out with friends, sleeping, etc.Time Management: Even though the first 9 weeks of this course are highly structured, you will still need to manage your own time well. This includes giving yourself enough time to sleep, even if your\'e not finished with all of the work due the following day. Weeks 7 &amp; 8 comprise a self directed project, and weeks 9 - 12 have very little structure at all. How much you get out of those last 5 weeks, and the amount of time it takes you to get job offers once the program ends all depend on your ability to manage your time well.Cost: aA now has several payment plans, some of which allow students to defer the bulk of tuition payment until they are employed as software developers. That said, the average job search takes between 3 and 6 months, during which those students are contractually restricted from part-time work. This means you will need to be able to afford food and housing, while not working for at least 6 months (the course + minimum job search). In New York. So even if this program was free, a large cost barrier still exists.Culture: Even though there\'s not a lot of time to socialize, the cohorts do tend to get pretty tight, and you will need to to help each other out a lot (emotionally and academically). In my experience, there was a strong culture of collaboration, not competition, which I think is strengthened by the emphasis on pair programming at aA. Okay, that stuff out of the way, you will learn more than you thought possible in the course. The instruction is fantastic, both in lecture and one on one settings. The curriculum also teaches you how to approach learning technologies not covered, which will be an essential skill upon graduating. Even though you will likely have to put in a decent amount of work after graduation in order to land a job, you will be well prepared to do so by the course itself. If you do decide to attend, you can mitigate a lot of the negative stuff above by preparing well. Attend either JumpStart of Bootcamp Prep. Be really thorough when going through the alpha curriculum prior to the cohort start date. Reach out to people who have gone through the program and ask lots of questions.Good luck!Read Less','app-academy'),(1713,234955,'A solid experience, definitely worth it so far','2018-04-03',0,4.7,5,4,5,'I have just recently finished the coding portion of the bootcamp curriculum at the NYC campus.

Throughout the course I felt like I was barely keeping afloat during the material, as most everyone else was, as your TA\'s will tell you, this is normal. As we progressed through the course, I found myself understanding concepts later on through the week, and slowly found myself struggling with newer material at the tail end of the course. I started to feel not as strong as I did earlier on and worried that I would not be ready to tackle the fullstack project that is completed after the coding curriculum. That was completely not true, once we hit our projects I found out how much I learned and quickly was able to cover the knowledge gaps I did have beforehand just by working through the projects.

Read More if I would ever get the opportunity to write one. Promised myself that I would only contribute to the pile if I made it all the way through the final and ultimate challenge: getting a job.I start Monday, so here goes.App Academy is a fucking rollercoaster and during moments of frustration, satisfaction, hope, despair, pride, humility, fun, fatigue, laughter, and crying I often thought: “MY FINGER IS ON THE MEDIUM POST”. Okay, that was only for the bad times. For both the good and the bad the thought was: “this is going in the review”. I can’t recall all of what I intended to say during those moments now and a Knausgaard-esque stream-of-consciousness account of my App Academy experience is not what these review sites are for. So I will organize my thoughts into categories and bullet points for maximum skimability.GENERAL:- Yes, you do work the crazy hours they say you do. I generally went to bed around midnight and was up at 7 or 8AM. 85-95 hours a week is accurate.- No, they are not scared of kicking people out. My cohort lost like 20 or 25+%? It can be emotional losing people you befriended. It is depressing seeing people who worked hard have to leave. A lot of it can seem like chance. Anxiety, illness, fatigue, or just having a bad day can make the difference between a pass or a fail. Your best defense against any of these factors bringing you down is simply to study extremely hard for the tests.- Yes, there is a deposit they don’t tell you about. - No, App Academy is not a scam. GOOD:- The TAs. They are all intelligent, articulate, and helpful. You get assigned a TA as an advisor/mentor and mine was above-and-beyond supportive and awesome (shoutout to Anastassia).- The other students. App Academy attracts a smart bunch of people from all sorts of different backgrounds. Seriously, everyone is so smart. It’s easy to bond with people and make friends when you are all going through the same crazy experience.- The Ruby and Rails curriculum (first 4 weeks) is excellent.- For me the full-stack project was the highlight of App Academy. It’s rewarding to see everything you have learned come together to create something real. And it feels great to be able to make your own direction and have some creative freedom.- You learn React which is hot right now and a big asset when on the job search.- App Academy was my only option when it came to bootcamps for financial reasons. It sounds corny but it felt like someone believed in me and was willing to put money behind it. This was encouraging and motivating during the hard times.- Practicing interviewing during the job search helped my anxiety and performance during interviews.BAD:- The JavaScript curriculum is a dumpster fire. It\'s like a hastily-assembled Sunday night book report. Whoever made it seems to have Googled around for definitions of various JavaScript concepts then stitched them together into new documents so App Academy could say it had its OWN JavaScript curriculum. Had to unlearn and relearn lots of JS later on.- There’s something to be said for all-JS bootcamps like Hack Reactor if you want to be a front-end dev (like me). But I also appreciated learning programming fundamentals in a language like Ruby where I am purely focused on problem-solving.- The pace and the learning style is not for everyone. I do not learn best through lectures and it takes a little bit of time for new concepts to settle in. So I found myself writing TONS of notes during lectures and asking for one-on-one help from TAs or other students when I needed it.- Parts of the job search can be very one-size-fits-all. I get why it is this way and that there needs to be accountability but it could be frustrating.- Algorithms lectures at the end of the course feel like trying to cram 4 years of CS concepts into your brain in two weeks. Lots of room for improvement in the instruction and the structure.- Constant stress, feeling like the dumbest person on earth because you are around such smart people, beating up your body from long computer hours.- Tehama.TIPS:- DO THE PREP WORK. Do it twice. Study with other people before you start. You want to come into this strong and passing the first few assessments puts you in a far less stressful situation.- Do the practice assessments a million times. Especially if you are a slower or weaker student like me. Don’t slack on the weekend! If you drill hard all weekend you probably will not fail.- Sleep. Your brain needs it to work right.- Ask about deposit assistance if you cannot afford the full $5k deposit. There are some diversity scholarships and other ways you can work it out with them.- If you get the opportunity to do JumpStart for your admissions process I highly recommend it.Read Less','app-academy'),(1720,243220,'An intense journey through web development','2018-03-20',0,4.3,4,4,5,'App Academy is definitely one of the most difficult programs to get into and stay in.

Read More helped me for the first week or two of AppAcademy (they taught Ruby in the beginning so there were common elements between them). However, I would like to stress that although it helped, it does not mean you can slack off. I consider myself pretty much an average student in the class during the whole main curriculum.I do believe the course is really intense. I also believe if you really put in the effort and really REALLY try to understand what is happening, the course is really not too hard. Assessments are always scary regardless. Two failures is pretty much where most people get dropped out. We lost like 10 out of 56 within the first two weeks. The schedule is basically lecture from 9 to 12 and then do paired programming classwork for remainder of the day. I\'ll list out a few key points that I learned and thought helped me:The first key point is to NOT GO OUT OF YOUR WAY to try and complete the daily projects. I know it sounds wrong but it is the a very very important lesson I learned. The instructors will tell you in the beginning that you do not have to complete the projects. Although it feels nice to complete one, the key point of paired programming interaction is to try to understand the material as a pair and mutually benefit. This means if one does not understand it, the one who does should be able to explain it well enough to him/her. This also helps the person explaining reinforce what they learned. You should not feel the urge to complete the projects. They were not made to be completed by most people attending the course but merely as a teaching guide. So really focus on trying to understand material and how it works. Try to do the projects to the best of you and your partner\'s abilities but do not try to over commit to it. Everyone also learn at different speed. Do not feel ashamed if you do not get to a part in the project that another group got to. You will all learn the same thing in the end. It is a cumulative learning experience.Another tip I learned was to always get your rest. So this and previous tip I mentioned were my mistakes in the first few weeks. I really tried to complete the work after class and cut down my daily sleep to approximately 5 hours per night on the first two weeks. I felt like I had to get a bit ahead in order to not fall behind. However, the end result was that my performance was worse the next day due to the lack of sleep and I actually get behind on that and the cycle just repeats. Set up a bed time schedule and stick to it. Whatever you are doing for the curriculum (except progress reports) is not urgent enough compared to it. If you did not understand something for the homework, they will explain it in class the day after. After I decided to stuck to my sleep schedule, I never really struggled on my work (except the first solo day, it was really rough though). I also gave up sleep to work on my full stack project. It ended up costing me two days of actual productive work.I guess the next tip would be to just do the work. It is long and grueling. There are no shortcuts to learning. Just do the work and do your best to understand the homework material. Concepts can be explained by the lecture the following morning or TAs. I can guarantee you that you would not fail if you diligently listen to the these tips. I honestly never read the project ahead or even look at the solutions after the end of the day. For homework videos, you should start using video speed player and get adjusted to the speed. You do not want to watch 3 hours of videos at normal speed. Slow down/pause at parts that you don\'t understand.I struggled mostly on week 1 where I really felt like I was underprepared. I did the precourse but there was a large gap until I actually started my cohort. I also was experiencing the struggles listed from the tips above. I struggled on the first solo day and first week of javascript since it was pretty new material coming at you really quickly. I honestly think I broke down maybe once or twice during my fullstack project. I was really sleep deprived and afraid that I won\'t complete my project (I do not think anyone really fully cloned their project but they did AMAZING work!). Stick to the tips even during fullstack project!

Read More long history of playing around with computers, but no academic CS background. My academic background is in the humanities (philosophy and theology) and I spent the first six years after college in grad school, then teaching, then working at a small magazine. The course is extremely intense. (I say this as someone who graduated in the top 10% of my class at Yale.) About 25% of my cohort was asked to leave because they couldn\'t keep up with the pace. That said, the instructors do a good job of helping you through each day, and the structure of the course itself, from one day to the next, is very thoroughly regimented. If you do the course, I recommend surrendering to the routine as much as possible. There is always more work to do—you will almost never finish a day\'s projects. The name of the game is to struggle for 14+ hours, get some sleep, and then struggle again the next day. You will work on weekends, you will not have a day off before week ten (and if you think you do, you\'re probably making a mistake). If you can keep up, you will find that the rate of your learning is really high.A typical day goes as follows: you arrive at the office by ~8:45am in advance of the morning checkin and go to your assigned seat for the day, with your partner for the day. 9 - 9:30am is spent doing a CSS exercise. 9:30 to about noon is spent in lecture (lectures have built-in Q&amp;A time, and a five minute break in the middle). Lectures cover everything from O(n) and implementing backend Auth to meta-programming in Ruby and state structure design in Redux. Lectures are generally reinforcement of the essential concepts from the previous night\'s readings and homework. This means they tend to be more basic, and more Q&amp;A oriented than the readings—as a result they can feel boring if you understood the readings right away, but the reinforcement is essential. At 12:30 there\'s a lunch break, which continues until 1:45pm. Some people work on homework during lunch, but the instructors encourage students to take the time to have a break. At 1:45 there\'s another checkin, after which you resume work with your partner, starting the day\'s projects. There are usually two or three projects, the first one deals with implementing the concepts in the day\'s lecture, and then the subsequent projects tend to be more advanced extensions of the same material. You will rarely get through the second project of the day. Many days you won\'t even finish the first. At 6pm an instructor dismisses the class and makes any announcements or reminders. After 6pm about 1/4 of the cohort will stay behind to complete their homework at the office. Most people go home to do the homework, which is usually ~3 hours, depending on the number of recorded lecture segments and readings. After finishing the homework, students are expected to review the solutions to the day\'s projects, and read through the next day\'s project instructions in advance.That\'s life for the first 7 weeks of the course. Assessments are usually on Mondays or Wednesdays. They\'re terrifying, very difficult to prepare for, and intense, but if you do what the instructors tell you to do to study, and use the provided resources, the test itself should go fine. In the 8th week the typical lecture/project/homework schedule goes away and students spend about 10 days doing individual full-stake projects. This building a production-ready clone of a major web application (facebook, airbnb, etc.) from scratch, on your own. Project presentations happen at the end of week 9, after which the jobsearch curriculum begins.

If I remember, I\'ll come back and update this review once some time passes so I can assess the program in light of its key promise: to help you get an engineering job.

Read More they reviewed it) in order to receive the hoody. Take that for what it is and if students would be capable of providing honest and unbiased feedback.My experience at aA has its ups and downs. I would say the environment that aA has created is great. Maybe I was fortunate with my class but my classmates were great and the staff I worked with at the time were extremely helpful.My issues with aA has more to do with how it is run from a systematic level. So I will list a few things to see if aA is the right environment for you, after going through it, personally it was not the right environment for me.The curriculum is extremely fast paced and loaded with work. If you have no coding foundation, you will easily put 80+ hours a week if you want to keep up. If you don\'t understand something, you may ask a question, hopefully the TAs or your classmates can help you. If you learn well under stress, then aA will be a good fit. I reached a point where my foundation was not strong with databases and it all fell downhill from there. There was a domino effect of playing catch up while trying to learn the new material. It did not work for me as new material was continually being given but I was already trying to play catch up. That is not how I learn, and I know most students in the program felt the same way as well.They have recently switched their pricing strategy, so maybe they are working to change the culture but this comment is made with the deferred tuition in mind.aA is a business first so their goal is to pump out students and for you to get a job. aA doesn\'t earn money in most cases unless you get placed. With that being said, the job search curriculum is fully driven by you. The expectation is to send around 40 applications a week (they have a strike system to try and keep you to that). The career support is not as developed as I was hoping. Your assigned career coach would normally just touch bases with you once a week, see what you are up to and maybe give a suggestion. They have very few formalized events (meetups, workshops) for those who are still looking for work to make their candidates more attractive.During the job search period (period after you finish the 3 month program), you are not allowed to leave SF or NY of within 40 miles without consent as they considered that a violation of your contract. And you are not allowed to work while you are looking for a job. If the job search goes long (you are not allowed to work unless you receive approval), be aware of that coming in.It should be noted that the job search stats are not voluntarily audited by a third party. I would take the numbers they have listed with a grain of salt on job placement and salary. The bootcamp markets is growing extremely rapidly (more competition for entry level) and yearly computer science enrollment for undergraduate has increased 3 to 4 folds (again more competition for entry level position) so the salary for entry level is starting to depress (from talks with recent aA graduates).Knowing what I experienced now, I would not recommend aA to the everyday person. If you are software developer that wants to learn the new technologies in web development, I think it would be a good fit. But if you are the everyday person, I would recommend to look at other boot camps or other alternatives (college) because I don\'t think the fundamental structure of the curriculum is the best learning environment for most people (high stress, fast, pile on work). With that said, I wish you all the best to those who are considering making the switch to software! I was able to get a job, but I felt my biggest strides took place when the stress of the program was taken away personally. If you have questions, feel free to leave a comment, I hope the transparency I have provided has given you another perspective of these alternative education institutions.Read Less','app-academy'),(1730,242820,'App Academy is Awesome; Job Search, Not So Much','2018-02-28',1,4,5,5,2,'App Academy opened a door to a career in software development that I didn\'t even know existed (I had thought six-figure software engineering positions only came through traditional paths, such as four-year CS degrees, etc.).But, after leaving a career...

I have App Academy to thank for this, hence the 5 stars.So I\'m happy to report that it\'s all pretty much as advertised. It\'s a rigorous 3 month course that will consume your entire life at the time, but you\'ll learn a ton, make great friends, and be able to land a fun and lucrative position (eventually) to kickstart your new career in software engineering.That said, something that wasn\'t fully emphasized to me upfront is that the job search can become a long, drawn out, exhausting process that I found much harder and less rewarding (at least in the short term) than the 3 months of intense coding. I believe the average job search time estimated when I first applied was 3 months, which was then later verbally estimated at 4 to 5 months, and ultimately ended up being 10 months, in my case.Don\'t get me wrong; we had one student from our cohort who had a job within 2 weeks of graduating and a healthy number of others had new jobs within the first few months, but many others had job searches much longer than that. Some landed jobs at Google/YouTube, Yelp, Dropbox, etc., while others at smaller startups, and many took on temporary contract work or internships; there\'s not a single path here, so there\'s diversity in the success stories and App Academy is pretty flexible in supporting you however you get there.In other words, I\'d keep that in mind and plan accordingly; you might get a job right away, but more likely it will take months, and could very well take almost a year to get an offer, in which case you need to be mentally/financially prepared for that going in. There\'s a lot of rejection involved when trying to get your foot in the door and all of these companies receive hundreds, if not thousands, of applications. If you\'re skilled at networking, you\'ll likely fare much better.You may have heard how much of a shortage there is for software engineers in the industry right now, but if you check out the job boards (or just attempt the job search), you\'ll soon find that the shortage is actually for experienced mid-to-senior level engineers, as there is an abundance of junior engineers coming from colleges, self-taught individuals, or one of the many bootcamps, which each churn out about 70 - 80 new junior engineers every three months, with largely the same technical background.In any case, even though it took me a grueling 10 month job search to finally fulfill the dream, I\'d definitely do it again, love what App Academy\'s given me, and am really excited to grow in my new career.I can\'t recommend App Academy enough; just remember that it actually gets harder after the initial 3 month coding program and that you may not feel relieved or at rest until you ultimately accept an offer.Thanks, a/A!Read Less','app-academy'),(1731,242793,'Difficult but Rewarding','2018-02-28',1,4,4,4,4,'I\'d summarize aA as a rewarding experience, albeit one that was occasionally frustrating.I came in without any coding experience beyond the Alpha course, which is the curriculum that they require you to complete beforehand.

Some people who\'ve been asked to leave after failing assessments (with a relatively generous prorated refund and kind words) have gone on to be TA\'s at other boot camps!The thing about stress is that it can make you grow. This is a data-driven insight, based in real neuroscience-- it\'s evolutionarily adaptive for people to be imprinted with vivid memories when experiencing raised stress levels. Being confronted with more material than you could possibly work through is both intimidating and inspiring, and App Academy will often introduce new material before old has had a chance to sink in-- this means that you always have a ton going on in the background. The majority of the class has had dreams about code-- I had one just last night about a non-existent interactive blue screen of death app! You also end up with little option but to work on code from roughly 9a until 10 or 11 (at least) most nights, it\'s literally not possible to keep up otherwise. If you don\'t like other people controlling your schedule, this isn’t great. But nonconformists can do well here. Myself, I come from a background in nightlife and production. I’ve never been much for structure, I can barely enjoy bowling, what with their ‘lanes’ and ‘scoring systems.’ But having a path hewn ahead of us through the jungle of code education has been extremely helpful in helping me stay focussed and avoid wasting time-- they really do point you directly towards what will get you producing good work, learning more fundamental concepts, and collaborating well with others.While being demanding on your time, App Academy also asks for a lot of independence. Much of the curriculum is written in a relatively terse style that demands the reader both be able to read closely through dense instructions and to be comfortable doing more and more independent research as the curriculum goes on, just like a real dev. The teachers are available to get you unstuck, but you’re encouraged to learn more about solving your own problems every day, and when coding in pairs, you will do tons of mutual troubleshooting, basically proving to each other that you can both teach and learn-- it is very normal to just engage with whoever’s closest to you about whatever bug you’re in the middle of, and people uniformly treat that as an opportunity to practice teaching and cement knowlege than as an interruption. The job search requires you to have a lot of discipline and follow-through, and it is very likely you will continue self-educating exhaustively throughout your career. Is it for everybody? No! But if it\'s for you, it\'s the best place you could be. I am quite sure that learning this amount of stuff would have taken me at least a year independently, and that there would have been much longer periods of feeling stupidly stuck. People who do well here tend to have had some contact with STEM in college or previous jobs, stay positive without much rest, are more excited about code than they are the idea of a huge income, are really good communicators and pleasant to be around, don\'t tire of reading a lot, have some sense of design, are able to call out of almost all work and social engagements for a few months, and respond well to being asked to just try as hard as they can.Read Less','app-academy'),(1752,241930,'A great decision.','2018-01-23',1,5,5,5,5,'I decided to enroll at App Academy to jump start my career change to software engineering.

CurriculumThe curriculum is easily the strongest part of App Academy. It is truly incredible how much knowledge you will walk away with if you are able to pace yourself and be consistent in doing all of the readings and preparing for the lectures everyday. They offer a lot, but they also require a lot out of you and it is difficult to keep up unless you are able to motivate yourself everyday.Luckily they provide intrinsic motivation due to pair programming and assessments. Knowing that you have to work with a different person everyday helps you make sure to try to get a good understanding of the subject matter so that you don\'t slow your partner down. Most importantly knowing that you could be kicked out by failing too many assessments will also motivate you to keep up. This was a main motivator for me attending, because I knew it would always keep me on my toes.At the end of the main curriculum you will be able to build a fullstack web application that is dynamic, complex, and impressive. That ten day project will be one of the most tiring experiences of your life, but you will be quite proud when you are done. Be sure to celebrate with your cohort mates when it\'s over.DiversityI added this category because I think it\'s important to note that App Academy is below average when it comes to racial/gender diversity. My cohort was about 5% women and 10-15% non white/asian. This did not affect my experience at all, as someone from an under-represented group, but I cannot speak for everyone and thought it should be noted for others considering App Academy.InstructorsThe instructors are usually App Academy grads. There is a question button during pair programming, which calls over a TA to assist you when you and your partner are stuck. They are all very cool, helpful, and the lectures are incredibly informative. The lectures will usually go over the reading and assignments for the night before and introduce some new material for the day ahead, so make sure you come prepared. Job AssistanceThe Job Search Curriculum in the last three weeks can feel a bit anticlimactic. You\'ve just spent 9 weeks going 100mph and then all of the sudden things slow down quite a bit. It can be a good thing because everyone is a bit burnt out from the fullstack project, but I wish there was a way to keep a similar pace going. Here you will work on your portfolio, build a nice online presence, learn how to approach networking, applying, negotiating etc. Don\'t come in thinking App Academy is going to provide you with all kinds of contacts and connections. I don\'t think they have any more ability to get you a job than any other bootcamp. However, they have a great reputation with companies in NYC and SF and a huge alumni network in those respective cities. I attended App Academy in NYC and I can tell you there are companies that only hire App Academy grads because the curriculum is more in depth and the projects are more impressive. OutcomePersonally, I applied to 305 jobs, had 6 phone screens, 3 on-sites, 2 offers, and landed an awesome job at a startup in NYC 3 months after graduating and I couldn\'t be happier. The job search is an absolute grind, but don\'t get discouraged. Just stick with it, apply everywhere, and don\'t say no to yourself! You never know who will get a job, even if everyone applies to the same one. There is a lot of luck involved and each person is unique even though you all graduated from the same course.Be financially responsible, make sure you have enough of a safety net so that you can focus, and it\'ll all come together in the end.Read Less','app-academy'),(1754,241733,'Difficult, But Worth It','2018-01-16',1,5,5,5,5,'App Academy was definitely the hardest 3 months of my life.

I remember sitting in the classroom on the first day, apprehensive and excited to start learning… since then it has been a whirlwind of learning and doing. You will look back and marvel at how far you have come in so little time. That being said, this program is hard work. You will need to steel yourself for long nights and stressful exams and projects. Some, of course, will have an easier time than others depending on your background and how well you’ve prepared for the bootcamp. But at one point or another, everyone who gets through puts in a lot of time and effort to do so.I have often been running on 5-7 hours of sleep—less on particularly intensive nights. I estimate I’ve put in roughly 80-90 working hours a week (more if you include my commute each day). If you want to keep up and get all the readings/activities done, expect to be spending many hours learning and coding. Fortunately, if you’re anything like me and most of my cohort-mates, then you’ll enjoy learning software development. By this point you’ve probably read a lot of reviews telling you App Academy is hard for many people. This is true. Some do not make it to the end. About 15 people from our class failed two assessments and a retake and were asked to leave as a result. However, I am a firm believer that if you’ve gotten through the applications process at App Academy, you have what it takes to make it to the end. If you end up going to App Academy, please believe in yourself, and work your ass off. A good number of my classmates failed the first assessment (by far the easiest one), bunkered down, and killed the rest. Do not be discouraged if you stumble. I’d like to close my review with some advice for prospective students. I have done fairly well with the program thus far and think it is prudent of my to share some of my preparation and study strategies that got me to where I am.1.	If you’re looking for introductory materials, I definitely recommend the MIT eDX course, ‘Introduction to Programming in Python’2.	Do as much preparation as possible. Of particular help to me was training fundamentals in Ruby on codewars. Aside from that, do what interests you from the options below:a.	Learn HTML5 and CSS3 at least to a basic level. In particular, learn the basic input types for html and how to use flex in CSS (look up flexbox froggy). If you can, try and recreate static versions of popular webpages from pure html and css.b.	Learn SQL. We did this is about half a week, but it was pretty rough for some. If you’re dedicated, you can do the same and not have to stress about it during the course.c.	Learn about the Model, View, Controller design pattern and its advantages/tradeoffs. Research ruby/rails or some other framework and see if you can learn the basics of app development. I would not recommend doing this before having a solid grounding in all the fundamentals though.d.	For the mathematically inclined with time before the course begins, go follow along with an algorithms course online. Learn big-O notation and algorithmic analysis. I personally followed along with the free MIT OCW lectures and assignments for 6.042J with Tom Leighton and 6.006 with Srini Devadas. If you already feel comfortable with basic programming and want to be ahead of the game for the job search, this is a good option for you. e.	If you really want to go the extra mile like me, go ahead and read a design patterns book (I used Head First Design Patterns, but Gang of Four is the canonical work to reference)3.	During the course, hit the ground running and do all the readings you can. Definitely drop all other responsibilities (or as many as possible). You don’t want to be dealing with anything else while tackling the curriculum. If you have a decent commute, it will be fairly impossible to do anything else. Speaking of the commute, preload the readings and download the videos they give you so you can watch them offline on your way there/back. If you can, study in the office around others where you can ask your classmates questions. If the homework is taking you too long, just send it up and put it away—you will be going over the material in greater detail tomorrow. 4.	Lastly, and most importantly: Make friends! You have the opportunity to study alongside many with similar motivations and career goals. Your classmates will be among your greatest resources during the course and moving forward. The people who are thriving in my cohort are largely those who made an effort to be social work with their classmates. Coming in to week 9, I can count a number of my them as good friends who I can expect to keep in contact with for years to come. For that reason alone, it was worth it to me to attend App Academy, and they’ve made my time here feel so nice.

The structure really helps reinforce topics: you watch videos and do readings as well as a short hw at night, then have a lecture on that material the next day and spend the rest of the day working through problems.

Looking back now, this miiiiight be possible, but it honestly would have taken me more than 10 times as long to do alone. Having the instructors on call, and the other students as pair-programmers was indispensable for me.

I\'ll discuss some reservations I had about App Academy, and some tips for future applicants/attendees. I come from a liberal arts background, and have never... Read More taken a computer science course before I started Jumpstart (a great way to get ready for App Academy\'s admissions process if you are offered a spot in the program). To be honest, I had reservations about the price tag of App Academy and whether it would be worth it ($22k+ is a lot of money).But as the course progressed, those reservations disappeared as I really realized that there was absolutely no way that I could have learned the amount of material on my own in such a short period of time. Prior to App Academy, I had a pretty decent job with great benefits at a private university, and part of the reason why I decided to leave that job was because of the amount of waste that I saw funded by student debt and high tuition prices. In contrast, App Academy\'s model of deferred tuition is still pretty revolutionary even if you have to pay a $5k deposit. I think part of what makes it work is that the student to instructor ratio is pretty low (I think it\'s around 1 to 8 or maybe 1 to 7 as we did loose 12 members of our cohort who did not pass the assessments). Again, that sort of student to instructor ratio is not something that is possible in most higher ed settings. There are 6 assessments throughout the course, and if you fail 2 (you are offered one opportunity for a retake after the second assessment), you are asked to leave the course. This causes a super stressful environment where many of the students are scared of failing out. The assessments do force you to internalize the material in a way that you probably wouldn\'t if you didn\'t have the assessments. In my opinion, the assessments are a flawed tool for measuring student progress, especially because it causes a lot of students to focus on just what would/could be on the test, but it is App Academy\'s way of measuring that you have the minimum amount of knowledge to continue progressing in the course (as I do think a few cohort mates who were asked to leave could have done well and finished if they had been allowed to stay). Aside from 1.5 to 2 hours of lecture, most of your day is spent pair programming with the same person for the whole day (for some projects, two days). Pair programming really does help you solidify your understanding, as you have to verbally communicate your thoughts to another person and vice versa, and forces you to stay on track the whole day. Except for maybe 2 instances, I found pair programming to be a very enjoyable experience. I will say that even if you\'ve never taken a computer science course, and even if you struggle to keep up throughout most of the course, if you are comfortable with pushing your boundaries and keep up with the course material, you can succeed. Prior to starting the actual course, App Academy gives you materials (Alpha course) to study on your own. Make sure you do all of it (twice, if possible!) and give yourself time to do it. This will set you up for success. They recommend 4 weeks for this prep work, but especially if you plan on working right up till you start the course, I would say you need more like 6 to 8 weeks. The last thing I wanted to say was aside from the mental exertion and total time commitment for 12 weeks, I found the course to be physically grueling, and felt absolutely exhausted the first two weeks of the course.

Hours of pair programming everyday can really break a person down especially if they are an introvert, and the speed at which we covered the material really makes you reevaluate your intelligence.

Imposter syndrome runs rampant, especially when you see people that you considered to be capable developers cut from the ranks (a good amount of students get cut from the weekly assessments), and it\'s normal to get up to week 8 and feel like you don\'t know anything at all, only to hit your fullstack project and pretty much learn everything out of necessity. Take away is this: know how to take care of yourself, know what you need to do to get by in a stressful environment, and be honest with the limit of your abilities. When your abilities seem to fall short of what is needed and you fail an assessment or screw up a project, learn to forgive yourself and pick yourself up and move on, there\'s no time to wallow, and there\'s no time to be so hard on yourself, the program is hard enough as it is.

Read More toes into the tech industry with this company, and having some familiarity with coding through Codecademy, I explored online how I could gain the skills I needed to have a career in tech.At first, I did an online graduate course through a university. The curriculum had holes (and it would have taken 2 years to get the degree). Based on that experience, I decided to look into coding bootcamps. I found out about App Academy through SwitchUp, which appeared as the top result of my google search.Looking through the different programs listed, not all of them had full-stack curricula. When I applied to some of them, all they had was a Skype interview and maybe some online prep material. App Academy stood out in that it had practice problems to solve, then an online coding challenge, then a technical interview, then an interview for cultural fit. It had by far the most fleshed-out, formal process from my experience.In addition, the deferred tuition model is appealing. But bear in mind the corresponding risks. If you have been a strong student academically or have prior experience coding, you will very likely make it through App Academy\'s curriculum. However, as App Academy scales, the 5% dropout rate of old is inaccurate--it\'s more like 20-25% in recent cohorts. The upside is that if things don\'t work out, you don\'t pay 100% of the cost. The downside is if you really want to get into software development, getting kicked out would really hamper that.How App Academy frames it is whether or not things work out for you, i.e. you are able to learn what they teach. Let me say: the curriculum is superb, the environment is supportive, and you are able to fail 2 of the 6 unit assessments and still make it through if you pass the retake of the second test.So as you compare your options, consider whether you are willing to pay $17,000 upfront to another top-rated full-stack program that won\'t kick you out, or if you believe you will respond well to App Academy\'s incentives and view the coding bootcamp more as a way to discover whether or not you want to be a software developer.All that said, if you make it through, you will build a clone of a major tech site. You will understand how the frontend, the backend, the database, middleware, and everything else functions. You will have a culture which facilitates a transition into tech extremely well (as you\'ll be pair-programming much of the day, every day).The last thing I\'ll note is that cultural fit is important.

It also became evident that most students came from educated, middle-class backgrounds and didn\'t have anything to lose by quitting their jobs to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Coding bootcamps are a business, period. But I personally believe that because they advertise themselves as a sort of trade-school-esque-alternative to college, they should make an effort to market themselves to the communities that statistically enroll less in 4-year colleges: individuals from working-class backgrounds and select minority communities.

In week 8, you\'ll combine back-end and front-end for in class projects AND your full stack project.- There is are HUGE emphasis on having readable code (having good syntax + variable names so other people can understand your code), DRY code , and the importance of modularity. These are all key concepts to any software developer.- App Academy has a job search curriculum other top bootcamps do not have. You go over frequently interviewed topics.- Learning so many things in 3 months though is mentally tiring. However, don\'t give up. Just keep learning. Once a week, I\'ll question if App Academy made a mistake in accepting me. I\'ll hit a huge conceptual roadblock and feel inferior to my peers. However, no pain, no gain. Usually the day after, I\'ll have more time to reflect on what I just learned and be able to use those skills right away in the current project.Culture:- The culture is so welcoming and inviting.- I felt other bootcamps I was interested had a more top-down culture. App Academy is more collaborative. - The emphasis is to learn and grow, not just plow through the material as fast as possible.- You can tell the staff loves what they do. There are cute animal references and memes all throughout the curriculum/lectures.Pro-Tip: - Use your weekends to the fullest. Take time to look into next week\'s curriculum as well as solidify your knowledge from the past week.- Learn the basics on Javascript ES5 and ES6 before the curriculum starts.- Make sure you put your best effort in learning the pre-course material.

As someone without a background I had to work constantly just to hang in there. Nearly everyday I was confused by what I was learning and that was definitely something hard to get used to. I’d never felt so impotent in my life. I averaged 5-6 hours of sleep at night and was slowly enveloped by a thick fog. The longer I went without sleep the more confusing and difficult things became. It got to the point I could barely remember the conversations I’d just had with people. Luckily I was always able to catch up on some sleep during the weekend and get back to ‘reality’ for a couple of days. If you are planning to take the course you should know that if you want to succeed the course will have to be your life. This is difficult to maintain, but it is possible.	In hindsight I believe I may have taken somewhat of the wrong approach to the course (although I don’t regret the way I accomplished it). I did everything they told us to do. I did all the readings and all the homeworks every night. This is the reason for my lack of sleep. I tried to do everything, and many of my fellow classmates did not. I think I allowed myself to get so tired that the work I was doing wasn’t helping as much as it was hurting me. 	If you’re looking just to pass the course, I believe it may be pretty easy. All the exams were very very closely related to the given practice exams. If you know how to memorize a practice exam and other topics that may appear on the exam, the exams are easy. You should be able to take the practice exam in half the expected time. If you can do that, I believe you will pass the real exam. There weren’t really any curveballs. 	That said we did lose many classmates from the exams. A student was even sent home on the last exam. I believe we lost a total of 12 people, and started with 62. I believe that those students probably had tried to do too much and weren’t able to effectively learn the practice exams. 	It’s a tough course and it’s important to make good friends throughout the program. Don’t count on being comforted by the staff. It’s required to fill out progress reports every night, but then you are given the impression that no one ever reads them. It’s like shouting into the wind.

Read More the program, have come out with a complete entry-level knowledge of full-stack development. The resources that have helped me from getting from point A to B in such a short amount of time was the rigor and depth of a/A’s curriculum. The most important reason is that the curriculum is so effective is that class-time enforces students to be immersed in programming and coding challenges for a maximum amount of time. The pair-programming aspect of the curriculum is a strong way to enforce communication skills and forces students to have a deeper understanding of new lessons when they are encouraged to explain their thought-process to their peers. The quality of said peers is also generally excellent in terms of character and ability. While pairing chemistry will never be perfect between every student, it was always evident to me that my peers took their time in the program very seriously and were always concerned with learning the material deeply, preparing for each class adequately, and producing high-quality work. The teaching staff is also generally excellent. I found that the quality of individual instructors would often correlate to their time in the program, but because the curriculum is so intense, the more junior instructors themselves also appear to improve quite rapidly. While there was sometimes a quality gap between new and veteran instructors, the actual time-difference between the former and the latter was usually only a cohort or two. And generally, I found that the entire package of TAs, who do all of the teaching at App Academy, was excellent and foundational to my own learning in the program.As for the cons, the largest is definitely the intense and disheartening aspects of the assessment structure of the curriculum. Personally, the assessments were the most important reason that I spent so much time working and studying outside of class hours. This is because if you fail two assessments, plus a single retake opportunity, you are dismissed from the course. With a weekend full of intense studying, I personally found the assessments to be fair and the course will give preparation materials that strongly correspond to the actual assessment. On the other hand, sometimes peers cannot make it through the grind of assessments: I believe that these individuals that were dismissed from the program do have the potential to be good programmers in the working world, and it was likely the pace of the curriculum, more so than its sheer technical difficulty, that was the largest hump to get over. Overall, my advice to prospective future students is that if you are confident in your programming abilities coming into the first week of the program, expect to still spend a lot of time on assessments and digesting the enormous amount of material from the week prior. If you are coming in less-confident, or even worse, having rushed through the four weeks of prep work, then expect to spend an extraordinary amount of time (and lack of sleep) on keeping your head above water. While the assessment structure does force students to master the material, for the most part, the stressful atmosphere that it creates through the whole school is an unfortunate trade-off.Finally, I wanted to comment on the quality of the facilities, which is important because students spend most of their hours here. During my cohort, the New York office got a significant upgrade in amenities and privacy. Before, both concurrent cohorts shared a single loft space with poor water pressure, mediocre bathrooms, and sometimes inconsistent internet. Now, each cohort gets their own floor to work on, and the office space includes a decent kitchen setup outfitted with utensils, plateware, drinking mugs/glasses, and a dishwasher. Most importantly, the coffee and teas offered by the building were significant upgrades over Folgers and Lipton. These small touches, for me, actually made a tremendous quality-of-life improvement; since most of our time will be in front of screens in the office, it’s good that the peripheral comforts are well-appointed.All-in-all I would recommend App Academy to those who want to make a tremendous career shift to a good field in the least amount of time possible. My warnings are regarding its pace, difficulty, and the toll it can take on your personal well-being.Read Less','app-academy'),(1813,239348,'Is it worth it?','2017-11-06',0,5,5,5,5,'Everything you\'ve read about App Academy is probably true.

But more importantly, most people who have gone through it will agree... Read More that it was the best decision they\'ve ever made and I can definitely agree. One of the greatest things about App Academy is the fact that they have the same goals as you: to land you a job. This is especially true when students (most usually do) take the deferred tuition model, which means not paying full tuition until accepting a full-time job offer. You can really tell that everything they do is to try to set you up for success. The work space is available 24/7 and there\'s always a TA available to help, whether it be in person or on Slack. It is important to note that while everything is laid out for your success in the course, how far you\'ll go is 100% dependent on the work that you put in. Due to there being no grades (aside from weekly assessments), it is sometimes easy for students to overlook some homework assignments and projects. If you\'re someone who likes to barely scrape by and do the bare minimum, then you\'re going to be in for a bad time. I had a few pairs I worked with that did not complete any readings and seemed very behind and those people ended up being the ones asked to leave after failing two assignments. On the contrast, those who study JUST for the assessments and put other parts of the curriculum on the backburner may pass all of them, will sometimes end up hurting themselves during final projects and end up having to relearn a lot of concepts that were not covered in the assessments. You really do get what you put into the program and knowing/balancing what concepts to focus on becomes a really important thing to learn over the course of the 12 weeks. Overall, App Academy was definitely worth it for me. If you\'re looking for a change in your life and you think that web development may be for you, I would urge you to apply. If you get through the application process and get accepted, the only thing that you will need to get all the way through the course is having the right mindset.Read Less','app-academy'),(1814,239343,'Challenging, Unique, and Wholly Worthwhile','2017-11-06',0,5,5,5,5,'My background and context: I come from a very non-technical, liberal arts background and my first time ever coding was about 5 months before my cohort started, while I was preparing for the JumpStart course (if you get invited to take part in JumpStart,...

Review: Overall, I would say that App Academy lives up to its ranking and is a great experience for turning someone like me, with absolute minimal tech / coding background, and in just 3 months turning this person into someone who can create a web app from scratch and can comfortably apply to jobs in that field. That being said, everything everyone says about the workload and intensity is completely accurate and you need to take it seriously. I gave up the vast majority of my life\'s activiities outside of a/A out of necessity - you really need to put in every weeknight and most of your every weekend into catching up if you\'re behind, getting ahead if you\'re not, or studying for the next week\'s assessment. Being someone who wasn\'t as naturally gifted or previously trained in the field, I had to work much, much harder and put in way more effort than those people so that I could still contribute and be productive in my daily pairings, projects, assessments, etc. Pairing - I found the pair-programming experience to be one of the most educational and enjoyable aspects of the program. Every day you are assigned a new partner to work with for the entirety of that day. You work through (and rarely complete) all of the day\'s projects together and over that time end up learning a lot, both about the person and about the day\'s material. Whether you find yourself to be the faster/more knowledgeable of the pair, or the slower/less knowledgeable, you end up learning at least a few things by day\'s end. Sometimes your partner will know a few cool keyboarding shortcuts in Atom that you hadn\'t seen before, or they will know some tidbit about Javascript formatting that you end up following yourself every time after, or they will have some alternative strategy to solving a problem that you find much easier to follow than the normal methods. I didn\'t have a single bad pairing experience in all 7 weeks of my pairings, half the time you end up eating lunch with your partner and talk, and most of the time by the end of the day you end up befriending one more person in your cohort. While everyone is learning the material at different speeds, you find that there are no dumb people in your cohort, every one is highly intelligent in different ways; they are the 2% that made it in with you and each is inherently capable of getting through it. Assessments - The assessments were definitely one of the more difficult aspects for me. The assessment policy is: out of 6 assessments in the first 8 weeks of the program, if you fail 2 of them (failure usually being defined around 85%), you are asked to leave the program, that day. This is where I find my only cons with the program. Having to leave the program that day, in front of all of your classmates, is downright brutal and borderline humiliating. If anything it motivates you that much more in your studying to avoid such an experience but I still think it is overly harsh - a simple email that night instead would be a less degrading situation, in my opinion. I also don\'t like that because of this intense Survivor-style policy, I was often put into the very difficult situation of having to choose between fully completing the readings/videos, and hw assignments for the weekend, or studying sufficiently for that week\'s assessment to avoid expulsion. While I tried to balance this as best as I could and ultimately did make it through, I hated having to make that decision each week and having to compromise my getting-ahead for that week. To get you through all of it, there is an amazing team of warm, highly-gifted instructors and TA\'s who come to your aid either in person or online at the push of a button and explain concepts and bugs to you until both of you are confident that you fully understand, all of your highly-motivated, chill-mannered classmates, and of course, Google :).Read Less','app-academy'),(1815,239342,'I know kung fu','2017-11-06',0,5,5,5,5,'There\'s no faster way on the planet to pick up this skillset.

The overall pace of the course is extremely fast, and it challenges your studying habits and your ability to overcome nearly incomprehensible material being thrown at you at lightning speed. 9 hours of class time per day along with hours of homework each night means that you end up eating and breathing code for 70-90 hours per week. Weekly assessments are given to ensure that everyone is on track, and two failures means you get removed; about a dozen people from the cohort didn\'t make it to the end and it kinda sucks seeing them leave. You could feel the stress hormones through the roof, and over half of the cohort experienced failing one assessment and the doomsday mindset that followed.

My classmates were all super chill and bright folks, and it was an absolute pleasure to be working alongside them and pairing with them every day.

Read More 13 since there\'s about 4 weeks of prepwork assigned before the course starts), I\'ve gone from 0 experience as a web developer to having created my own full stack web app using a Ruby on Rails backend with a React with Redux frontend. I can\'t speak yet to the quality of their job search curriculum, which I will go through over the next 3 weeks, but I will say that their full stack curriculum is absolutely effective for a few reasons. First, you should know that some of the students, roughly 15% in my cohort, were dismissed for not passing assessments before completing the curriculum, so being accepted is only the beginning of the journey. The ones who made it through are absolutely better programmers for having gone through the program. Many of my classmates started with little to no experience programming, and are full-fledged web developers now.I believe the reason a/A is so effective is, in a word: reps. Every day, there are 2 hours of lecture, and then you peer program for 5-6 hours. Then there are homeworks and readings to do before you get to class. Shower, sleep, and repeat for 9 weeks. Peer programming is a process through which you sit down and talk through and try to solve problems with someone else. There are many factors conducive to learning and skill development at play during this time. First, learning to verbalize your approach to a problem is immensely helpful to refining and solidifying knowledge. Second, having the accountability to keep trying to solve the problem and having help when you need it keeps the learning process moving. Third, an understated part of programming is looking up and researching documentation, which you will get a lot of practice doing. Last but not least, you are experiencing the same thing while you drive and your partner navigates, so you have the benefit of differing perspectives every day. Before I started a/A, I thought these skills were something I could learn on my own, but would be faster with a teacher. That\'s partly true, but it\'s also true that your fellow students aid in the learning process immensely. If I were describing a/A to a prospective applicant, I would tell you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to work hard and learn. That\'s all it is.

So for me, it was hard to decide for Prep... now I don\'t have any doubts about spending this money for Prep and especially for Bootcamp.Anyway, at the Prep App Academy, Alvin and David will prepare you for Bootcamp, they will tell you what to do and how to do, and you won\'t waste time for trying to pass a technical interview. Especially because you can\'t try every week.And the last thing was very important to me - I stopped frustrating! That\'s it!!!! I started coding with confident and solid understanding what I am doing. The teacher (Alvin) and his assistant (David) are great guys! Very patient and smart people!

In the beginning, you\'ll learn about various CS fundamentals and the inner workings of several languages and frameworks, so just when you finally become comfortable with one thing, something new comes up.

I learned to develop web apps from scratch in just twelve weeks.','2017-10-22',0,5,5,5,5,'General Summary: I wholeheartedly enjoyed my twelve weeks at App Academy. The program provides an intense, unique experience. Basically, it lasts twelve weeks: the first nine weeks comprise the “Technical Curriculum” and the last three the “Job Search... Read More Curriculum”. However, after being admitted and accepting your offer, you have to complete a one-month online course called “Alpha Prep” before starting. The technical curriculum is intense. In seven weeks, you will learn all the material you need to be able to develop your own React/Rails web app from scratch in the eighth and ninth weeks. On a daily basis, you will have many projects (whose material you covered in readings and videos the night before) to work on with your partner. You’ll learn Ruby, Postgresql, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React/Redux. However, pair programming and the “question button” system serve to alleviate some of the stress of the course. Pair programming is basically you coding on a single pc (and keyboard) with a partner. Every fifteen minutes, you switch “drivers”, i.e., the person who is physically typing on the keyboard. For the first couple of days, you might feel uncomfortable having to code all day with a partner, but the benefits of doing so become apparent soon after. Having to verbalize and communicate problems to someone else rather than hacking away at the keyboard forces you to become methodical in your approach, and it helps you ask better questions when you’re stuck. The “question button” is a button on the internal web app that puts your name on a question queue. The TA’s are pinged every time a person is added, and they come by to field students’ questions on a first-come, first-served basis. The benefit of this system is that it allows all students an equal opportunity to have their questions answered and it deals with the issue of less vocal or visible students receiving less attention. The job search curriculum begins in the tenth week. By that point, you will have learned all the skills you need to develop fully functioning web apps from scratch. However, simply because you have learned the technical material doesn’t mean the course becomes less intense. In these three weeks, you will work on your résumé, cover letters, online presence, personal pitch, and whiteboarding problems. In this aspect of the course, you will receive a lot of support from the career coaches. They will review your projects portfolio, résumé, etc, in depth and will give you detailed pointers on how to improve each item.	Pros:	The TA’s are always on call, and they generally are able to pinpoint your problem within seconds and do not leave you until all your doubts are assuaged.Almost the projects serve some practical use, and the emphasis on repetition ensures that you internalize the material.Pair programming makes the experience more enjoyable, and it ensures that you rarely get bogged down with trivial bugs.The career coaches provide a lot of support in the job search. They help with your portfolio, personal pitch, networking skills, online presence, and negotiation.App Academy’s alumni network is helpful and supportive.Cons:The curriculum is constantly being updated so sometimes you will find some inconsistencies in the material. This problem does not appear so much in the 12-week program itself, but it is definitely noticeable and distracting in the Alpha Prep course. As much as I love pair programming, you will have days where you work with someone you find intolerable. Fortunately, this only happened to me three days out of the roughly 35 in which you pair program, but this experience is variable.There are six assessments throughout the course, and they are a bit stressful because if you fail any two of them, you are asked to leave the program with your initial deposit refunded. Moreover, because they are graded automatically, they are unforgiving--meaning that a single typo can cause code with otherwise sound logic to fail their automated tests. However, the expectations of the assessments are straightforward and you are given plenty of time and material to prepare for them.Caveats:If you are not an independent learner, you will have a hard time at App Academy. Despite the great amount of support you will have, there is a lot of material and little time. If you assume App Academy is like a traditional educative program where the student plays a more passive role, you will likely struggle through it. This is not a criticism of the instructors (I hold them in high esteem), but it is simply the nature the program.You will not have time for anything else. This is not an exaggeration. I taught myself to code for half a year before attending App Academy so the first three weeks were relatively light for me. That being said, I was only able to have weekend evenings free during this time. When it came time to create our web apps from scratch, I literally had no time for anything else even on the weekend. Some people assume that the job search curriculum is less intense than the technical curriculum. This is not true so don’t get your hopes up!Read Less','app-academy'),(1827,238895,'App Academy Review','2017-10-17',0,5,5,5,5,'I was part of the May 2017 NYC cohort and had an amazing experience. I put in a lot of hard work, often not getting home until after midnight but It was so rewarding that It felt like I was just having fun.Cons:1. The rigors of the job search. For me,... Read More the most difficult part of the entire process was the job search. I enjoy coding and solving problems but I absolutely hate sending emails and writing cover letters to try and \'sell\' myself. This is not something specific to App Academy, but it is something to be prepared for. It took me over two months until I got an offer that I was happy with. About half of my cohort had to wait even longer. I know that doesn\'t sound like a long time but it IS when you\'re going through it. There were times that I didn\'t get any responses for weeks at a time and felt like I would never find a job.Pros:1. The tuition model. I applied when the tuition was 20% of the starting annual salary of the job I accepted. (They actually proactively lowered it to 18% because some students in my cohort had applied at that rate). For me, the low-risk payment model removed one of the greatest barriers to entry. It also gave me confidence that our goals were aligned and that success rates advertised were accurate (I too was skeptical before I experienced the outcomes first hand).2. The students. Once I got in, I began to appreciate that App Academy sets a high bar and selects only the top 3% of applicants. Learning with a group of talented and intelligent students becomes a real advantage when you get stuck, don\'t understand something, or just need to discuss a concept.3. The curriculum. The learning at App Academy follows a pattern of learning new material for homework, clarifying the details in the morning lecture, and hands-on experience in the afternoon projects. The curriculum is kept up to date with the latest stable technologies and focuses on applying the knowledge. For me, this helped in retaining what I had learned and cumulatively building upon it.4. The career coaching. My App Academy career coach was AWESOME! The career coaches help students polish their resumes, online profiles, and cover letter templates. They also help to find and fix the bottlenecks in the job search. (For me it was the online profiles and resume. For others, it was practicing technical interviewing or adding features to their showcase projects).

My advice: take the practice assessments as many times as you can, and the chances of failing are much lower. I spent 10 months searching for a job. When I started my job search, my soft skills were weak, and my technical skills needed a lot of improvement. I practiced around 3 times a week doing practice interviews and white-boarding with my friends using Skype. My coach taught me how to sound prepared and confident on the phone, and checked on me weekly to see how I was doing with my job applications. The job search team also schedules mandatory workshops for job-seeking graduates to learn new skills and review concepts. They provide a really comprehensive list of networking events and meetups in the Bay Area where you can meet potential recruiters and other engineers.

Strikes are for absences and lateness so be on time! People have been dismissed from the course this way.The curriculum was interesting and my new job has even drawn on what I have learned there so it has definitely been valuable. I really like that they are constantly revising the course to ensure it is up to date and relevant. Almost every day was pair programming on projects which I think is a great way to learn since you don\'t have to struggle by yourself. One downside to the constant updating is that some of the curriculum is rough around the edges and it often seems like we were only working on a given topic for 2 days at most before we moved on. It\'s easy to feel overwhelmed but your fellow students and teachers are always there to help you. They have office hours everyday and people often stay late to do homework together if you need it. It helps to find people who live near you and make a study group.It\'s also great that part of the course is focused on job search and interviewing skills because I never felt like I knew anything about this. It was very helpful to learn about writing resumes and cover letters. The job coach I had was really insightful and I owe him a lot. You\'ll get lots of whiteboarding practice too which is great because it\'s so awkward the first time you do it.I met a lot of nice and interesting people and there\'s great diversity in the student body.

The course has a ton of great TA\'s, so even if you are feeling overwhelmed, there\'s always someone to talk to for help. Classmates come from all backgrounds and walks of life, but pretty much everyone was the same beginner when sitting down at the computer to pair. Because everyone is there for the same reason (to learn and become developers) everyone is willing to help out each other. One warning: the course isn\'t lying when they say you will spend upwards of 90 hours a week programming. There is plenty of work to do outside of the classroom, and you\'ll want to do all of it to make sure you don\'t fall behind. The information is actually quite interesting and the lecture videos are well done, but it will be in your favor to keep on top of the work. There\'s also a great alumni network to help find jobs after the course is officially finished. Because App Academy is one of the few long-lasting coding bootcamps, companies have learned that their graduates are different than other bootcamp graduates and are more willing to give potential employees the time of day.Overall, I had a great experience at App Academy. It nurtures a collaborative atmosphere unlike many other places of learning.

This speaks to the dedication of the staff to producing graduates that are not only capable, but who take initiative to fill the holes in their knowledge. Pair programming is mandatory during most of App Academy\'s curriculum, a standard that encourages peer teaching outside of the normal class hours. This vibe sticks around, resulting in students that aren\'t competitive, but rather truly cooperative. Much of App Academy\'s value lies in their philosophy of pairing and peer teaching. Before applying to App Academy, I had read all the common sentiments in their reviews: It was like drinking from a firehose, You really will spend 100+ hours a week, It was absolutely the most difficult and most rewarding thing I\'ve ever done. All those things are true. There were days when I hated this place, and there were days when I loved it, and I would assume the same is true for most students who go through this program. Some days the obstacles seem insurmountable and you wonder what you\'re doing here; other days you wonder why you ever considered doing anything else. App Academy is a world of extremes. With extreme frustration comes the extreme satisfaction in the truth of saying I can do this because I just did it. Before coming here I saw a tweet that simply read Do what you can\'t.

One of them accepted me right off the bat and I knew they were the wrong choiced. Others asked me to accomplish things in coding challenges that were far beyond... Read More my skill level without offering any instruction or legitimate curriculum. With App Academy, the application process was very challenging, but you are given every opportunity to succeed via their resources. Also, the actual challenges they give you are algorithm challenges, very similar to whiteboarding questions you may get when you interview for a Developer position. This is in contrast to other challenges that ask you to build a Rails Twilio application or some other project that is very practical in nature. Yes, building an application is a great way of finding out whether someone is a good programmer, but it tells you nothing of their potential. However, if you teach someone some basic programming principles and data structures: what is a string? an array? etc. and then ask them to solve a question that uses those data structures, it is a much better way to guage someones potential by seeing if they are capable of applying what they are learning. Building a full application is much too difficult a task to ask of a newbie without spelling out every step and at that point, you may as well just write the code for them.So aside from the deffered tuition (which is nice), the application process is what got me hooked on App Academy.Once you get in, first the first few weeks all you want to do is survive. You will be kicked out if you fail two exams. The first people to go are people who can\'t type (it\'s painful to watch them type with only their index fingers) and people who don\'t speak English as their first language. That\'s not to say that everyone who doesn\'t speak English as their first language will fail, not what I am saying. However, the sheer amount of information that will be thrown at you is mind numbing and every lick of it is in English. If there is no language barrier, you still only absorb ~75-85% of what you are taught. If there is a language barrier, that percentage drops. This makes it difficult to keep up in a very fast paced environment. I noticed the people who spoke English as a second language and did well in the class either had prior coding experience or were just insanely sedulous and dedicated to the craft. It can be done, but it is certainly harder.Once you make it past the survival phase, which is after the fourth assessment (say week 4), then you start to think, Ok, I don\'t want to just survive anymore, I want to excel. This is where the course gets really exciting because you begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. You start to think about things like a programmer. You get re-programmed. That\'s what this program does to you, it programs you to be a programmer (you like what I did there?).If you\'re smart, you may be wondering, Well what are some flaws, some bad things about App Academy. The one thing I can point to, which I got over once I bought into the program is this: you are not attending a/A to create a startup when you graduate. I have a ton of ideas for startups, yes, but if it\'s one thing I learned during my time at a/A, it\'s that programming is very hard and it will take time (and more importantly, work experience) for you to be good. The goal of an a/A graduate is to get a job, not to start a company with a cool new application that revolutionizes an industry. Get a job, pay us back, get some experience, and then go start a company. That is the message and to be honest, I agree with it. Now some other bootcamps, like Full Stack Academy, have avenues for students to pursue their startup aspirations. This is a luxury that only a school who is already paid can afford. At a/A, they don\'t make money unless you do and most startups don\'t make money, they cost money (trust me, I know firsthand). Now, if they don\'t get paid unless you do, that means they have a vested interest in your getting paid. This system of deffered tuition is one that Milton Friedman espoused in his book Free To Choose. He devised this as a way to pay for education without the government paying for it, but admitted it would be very difficult to implement. Well, App Academy implemented and guess what, it works! The curriculum kicks ass. It is laid out in such a way that each topic builds on the next and moves very quickly so that every week your knowledge grows exponentially. I\'m not going to go into specifics on the curriculum, the website does that. But I will say that I remember thinking often, Wow, this curriculum is so good.

For the first time, I found a school whose tuition model aligned with my own personal goals. The better I did, the better AA did.The rumors are all true. No amount of words can describe the rigor and the challenge of the program. An 80-90 hour weekly commitment is typical. You\'ll lose sleep. You\'ll be challenged consistently and think I\'m not sure I can finish this. You\'ll be surrounded (and outcompeted) by some of the most gifted people you\'ll ever meet. You\'ll fail to understand a topic on a Saturday and pass an exam on it on Monday. Once the learning curriculum concludes, you\'re thrust into the job search, which is filled with entirely different challenges -- personal projects, phone calls, take-home assessments, technical screenings, whiteboarding sessions, in-person interviews, salary negotiations.And then, almost miraculously, things start working out. You get complimented on your GitHub code at interviews, you do well at whiteboarding sessions, you get offers that are almost double what you earned at your previous job. You have the confidence to choose which offers to accept and which to reject.A single review can\'t do AA justice. It truly provides a life-changing experience. The TAs are phenomenal --- amazingly brilliant people who not only understand the material but have a genuine desire to help others. The in-class pair programming assignments are perfectly structured; there is enough material to ensure a good 5-6 hours a day could be spent coding. The caliber of the students is phenomenal -- lots of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. The job placements team is stellar as well; all were confident career coaches that were eager to lift you up and fill you with optimism.All in all, I have zero regrets about the program. All promises were kept. It was the most challenging educational endeavor I\'ve ever attempted but, thanks to App Academy, I feel confident about my future as a software engineer.

Your priority during boot camp MUST be in this order from most important to least important: Sleep, food, studying, everything else. If you do not sleep properly, you will not retain the information you\'re cramming, especially if it\'s all completely new. You will learn the most by doing what you read about the night before, and you won\'t be able to code the next day on no sleep and an empty stomach. Also, when you apply to jobs, apply to everything at once. You will have the best chances while all your projects are fresh. You have nothing to lose by getting in touch with hiring managers and CEO\'s of companies. Do what it takes and be sure to keep coding.

Despite that it feels a bit lacking coming from the main curriculum.On a final note. There will always be times when you feel in over your head. There will always be times when you doubt your own ability.

After receiving acceptance, I went through the online a/A preflight materials called Alpha course for about a month. Once the actual course starts, time flies so fast.

Some side effects of this bootcamp: since the pace is so rapid it\'ll force you to confront with yourself with learning how to learn. It\'ll also help teach you how to develop a strong work ethic that requires serious commitment and sacrifice. Downsides: the learning curriculum is done via pair programming with another student for six hours almost everyday. Although I see the value of pair programming forcing you talk through your ideas and working collaboratively, I also I believe learning should mostly be a personal experience and journey where you have the space to explore you\'re own thoughts on concepts.

I was waiting... Read More until I found a job before I wrote this review. To be transparent, App Academy offers a free sweatshirt for writing reviews, regardless of rating, but my intention here is to share my experience and honest opinions.Initially I applied to App Academy and Hack Reactor, as these appeared to be the top two bootcamps with the most rigorous admissions process. I ended up choosing App Academy because you learn two languages, Javascript and Ruby, and they offer tuition deferment. The curriculum is App Academy\'s best asset. I can attest that they teach Ruby, Rails, SQL, and React very thoroughly. They lay a strong foundational basis for Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, and algorithms for you to improve upon later. And you will have to study some of these topics on your own to get to a level sufficient for employment, particularly when it comes to Javascript. Other positive points of the program include pair programming, supportive staff, smart cohort mates, etc. The staff for the most part consists of App Academy graduates, teaching and non. This is a double edged sword; on the one hand they know the curriculum very well, having gone through it themselves, but as most of them don\'t have industry experience, it becomes challenging when you have question beyond the scope of the curriculum. App Academy is also deeply committed to providing a safe, inclusive environment. They take violations of their code of conduct incredibly serious and as a female of color, I very much appreciated these efforts.The job search curriculum is not as strong as the academic portion, but it is a work in progress and constantly changing. I was expecting App Academy to have built connections with recruiters and companies over the past several years, but that was not the case. There is a small team called Talent Match that does focus on outreach to companies, but no one that I know in my cohort or previous cohorts has found work through them. You are pretty much on your own in terms of finding and securing work. App Academy provides resources and suggestions on where to look for work, how to write your resume and cover letter, how to network, what networking events are happening each week, interview practice, etc. but this information is also readily available on the internet. They do have a relatively good alumni network (that\'s how I ended up finding my job) but that is mostly dependent on the individual and how willing they are to help others. I\'d like to see App Academy have hiring partners that recruit directly from App Academy graduates and continue building their alumni network.In the end, it took me three months to find a job, which is about average. For me, the job search was the hardest part. I had to do CONSIDERABLE additional learning on my own, with little App Academy structure and the entire reason I wanted to attend a bootcamp in the first was place was to have everything laid out for me. Recently App Academy added a job seeker program which was somewhat helpful in organizing my time and giving me some form of structure. From what I\'ve seen, it\'s taking each cohort longer and longer to find work. Alums I spoke to from a couple years ago often found work within weeks. The first person from my cohort to find work took almost a month. This is no surprise considering the volume of students that App Academy and other bootcamps graduate every few weeks. The best piece of advice I can give here is to be prepared for that both financially and mentally. Also recognize that it really is a numbers game, the more jobs you apply to, the better your chances of an interview, and the more interviews, the better you get at them, the more likely you are to get an offer.To address and/or echo some of the comments/criticisms that have made here. Yes, the 13 weeks are extremely time intensive and you will probably feel burned out at the end (I know I did). You don\'t have much time to recover post program/pre applying to jobs, however, I did find the staff accommodating and reasonable like humans, not like corporate robots. There are rules because students perform better when there are consequences but the rules are not so rigid that App Academy will not work you if have a concern.Read Less','app-academy'),(1879,237157,'Believe the Hype - but get ready to work','2017-08-12',0,4,4,5,3,'App Academy has life changing potential. I think we can all agree on that given that the program offers to make you eligible for Software Developer jobs in the span of three months. There are some caveats though. I\'ll address the negatives of the program... Read More before I delve into why I think it is a fantastic program that everyone should consider. The a/A lifestyle is not for everyone. Whether you are invited to Jumpstart, or make it through to receiving an offer, it becomes quite apparent that a/A does its best to recruit the best, brightest, and youngest to their program. Completing this program fortified my passion for coding. If you can\'t picture yourself coding from 9am-6pm (with a lovely 75 minute lunch) and then doing homework until 10 or 11PM every night, then you may want to reconsider. The material itself is not super, super dense, there\'s just an absolute ton that they shove at you in 8 weeks. In essence, be ready for your lifestyle to be a/A all the time. Myself, and a lot of my cohort mates would take Saturday off and play basketball Sunday mornings - so I want to be transparent when I say that although it consumes your entire life, there are patches of time to catch your breath. The range of students also varies considerably, but by the end of the program everyone is committed to finishing together. One fact that I heard a lot, yet still surprised me was how diverse the cohorts are. Keep in mind software engineering is some really hard stuff. Learning Javascript in one week is not for the weak, so it makes sense that a majority of attendees come from prestigious schools. If that makes you wary, don\'t be. We had students with backgrounds from MIT, Standford, Princeton, dozens of mechanical and electrical engineers, former employees at firms such as Google, Goldman Sachs, Mckinsey. But we also had multiple people who failed college, only attended community college, had never held a job more than 25k. I think youre starting to get the picture. The people that have a limited background in tech/engineering/coding do typically do better but that\'s true with most endeavors in life so I hope that doesn\'t deter anyone reading this. What\'s vitally more important is being flexible and having a lot of drive. There\'s not a person above 30 in our group, and it makes sense given that a lot of us dropped everything to come to a city with the highest rents in the country and a full-time curriculum to learn in a matter of months. It\'s overwhelming, and they specifically design it that way. Again, I want to repeat that because people will bash a/A for stopping to help them when they\'re struggling, or going too quickly through the material, but they design the course to make it feel like you\'re always inches away from drowning. They don\'t have time to make it easy because you\'re competing with unemployed young guns with a fancy CS degree and boatload of knowledge.Their contract sounds strict, but when it comes down to it they really want to help you find a job. If they had any loop holes they\'d be exposed and taken advantage of. You can\'t offer someone a free curriculum without being sure that they will do everything they can to go out and get that job upon completion. Again, you have to be ready to work and that is even truer during the job search curriculum. It\'s also worth mentioning, because people read too many marketing materials and get a ridiculous thought in their heads, that they will make 100k in 12 weeks. There are probably 2-5 people in our graduating cohort (out of 70) that could obtain that. The majority of graduates take 90 days to find a job so take that into account as you\'re doing your preparation. A few parts of my a/A experience that I am forever grateful for are the relationships that you make and the material that you learn. It\'s actually pretty easy to show up to a place that day in and day out keeps trying throw more and more work on top of you. The biggest reason is because you develop extremely close relationships with a lot of people as you tackle trial and tribulations together. In the end, you enter the job market with a network of 1000+ a/A grads that know everything you went through. Don\'t underestimate the people in your cohort. A lot of us all came in with the same mentality of buckling down and getting the job. Like actual software development, you need to rely on your team in order to achieve.Every day is long and tiring. Every day will waver your self-confidence and raise your level of impostor syndrome to unprecedented heights. But every day is also extremely riveting and fulfilling. You will do and create things you wouldn\'t imagine. You find a way to get it done, and then you do it. That\'s engineering. That\'s innovation.Any questions, feel free to shoot me an e-mail. I was once in your shoes but somehow after twelve weeks of telling myself to take it one day at a time, I finally emerged as a software developer - and know that you can too.Read Less','app-academy'),(1880,237153,'App Academy is hard','2017-08-12',0,4,4,3,5,'ProsVery knowledgeable TAsCaring StaffStudents encouraging each otherChallenging curriculumConsRequires 100+ hours a weekDesigned for students with prior coding experience','app-academy'),(1881,237086,'Worth it!','2017-08-11',0,4.7,5,5,4,'App Academy has probably been one of the best and most unique experiences I\'ve had.

With that being said, App Academy really isn\'t for everyone, but one thing is certain: you will leave knowing a lot more than when you started.Before App Academy, I did not have much programming experience besides basic knowledge of SQL from my previous job. However, within three months, I learned Ruby on Rails, postgreSQL, JavaScript, jQuery, React and Redux and can now make my own full stack applications! App Academy isn\'t a perfect program. The course load is challenging and the pacing is very fast. It\'s very easy to fall behind if you\'re not committed--and even if you are committed, it\'s possible to fall behind if you don\'t understand the topic before they move forward in the curriculum. However, they have a very dedicated and knowledgeable staff to facilitate the students\' learning experiences.My biggest gripe about the App Academy is how assessment-focused the program is. Their assessments determine your status in the program and due to fear of dismissal, many students solely focus on passing them instead of learning/understanding the material. (If this sounds confusing, it will make a lot more sense if you go through the program). With everything being said, I really enjoyed my experience in App Academy, minus the stress and sleep deprivation. I have met some of the most amazing, supportive, and hardworking people in the amazing App Academy community.

Read More and, maybe most importantly, a capacity to efficiently learn new technical material. The coding portion of the curriculum is difficult, but at the same time structured, well organized, and jam packed with intersting and relevant material. Some of the material is presented in a lecture format, but the bulk of the work is done pair-programming with fellow students. From day 1, this model fosters collaboration and encourages students to solve problems independently, instead of following along with examples. This being said, the instructors are encouraging, readily available, and all-in-all wonderful. Many of the instructors have gone through the bootcamp program as well, so they are knowledgeable in both the technical and social/stress-management aspects of the curriculum. While there are weekly assessments, the focus of the program is for you to learn as much as possible, not to transactionally complete assigned projects / homework assignments. In this way, students come away with not only the necessary skills, but also the drive, to start their own projects. Part of the coding curriculum involves completing three large projects, all of which you effectively design and plan yourself (with the support of instructors). These three projects become the focal point of your software portfolio, and are not something that other bootcamp grads can typically claim. Aside from portfolio building, the job-search part of the curriculum is packed with mock-interviews, networking workshops, and time with a personal career coach. Even post-graduation, App Academy leaves you with technical and networking resources, not to mention close connections to all of the other members of your cohort. The bottom line is this: App Academy is a serious time and energy commitment, but leaves you with a range of technical knowledge, an industry ready portfolio, strong technical interviewing skills, and a serious sense of personal pride for having made it through all of that in 13 weeks.Read Less','app-academy'),(1934,236261,'Best Coding Bootcamp, But Not for Everyone','2017-05-29',0,5,5,5,5,'This program is a lot of work.

Time is of the essence in a fast-paced course like this and there\'s no way anyone can \'get\' everything that is taught in the 9 weeks as quickly as they would like.

I consider myself one of the slower classmates when it comes to studying (when I see 30min reading it really means 1hr) and living 10 minutes away has saved me so many times from chopping the resource most essential to a bootcamper: sleep.-Find some way you can offer value and share it! I find that a large part of my motivation to learn about something really well is to be able to talk about it with someone later on.

Read More app academy to having actual software development experience (rare). But I think it\'s safe to say for the majority of us, it took up all of our time during the week and (for me) weekends.2. How to succeed?Work hard.

Aren\'t there tons of free material online for this?Extremely difficult, at least in this short amount of time. The free resources that I used seemed to go from doing for loops to hey now go make a project. It\'s very easy to run into a bug or a question that you can\'t figure out when learning on your own. It\'s also very easy to give up. You won\'t have TA\'s to ask questions or give you feedback. When I was trying to learn this on my own, it was like running through a wall.

No more training wheels.Ultimately you\'re exposed to just about the whole breadth of the field, enough to know where to start when you want to go deep and leverage a different technology.

Read More where the interviewer was taking a Lyft or something while he was conducting my interview). The curriculum itself is really really well designed, not only building on itself to facilitate learning and deep comprehension, but is constantly being updated to incorporate the most highly demanded and up to date technologies. In my cohort they trained us to be strong React and ES6 developers, while not neglecting the older technologies, like jQuery. This turned out to be invaluable in the job hunt, since a lot of companies were looking for React developers when we graduated. I was skeptical at first about their emphasis of Ruby on Rails, since most companies seem to be moving away from that, but in retrospect, it really is the best way to learn about how a full stack application works, especially for people with less experience. And they do their best to give you a deep understanding of why things work the way they do so that those skills are transferrable. The program also gives you a good foundation in algorithms, web and backend architecture, and interviewing skills. I was just amazed at the amount of knowledge I had gained after the 13 week program. I received 5 job offers within 3 weeks of graduating, one of which I ended up accepting, and I\'m very excited to be formally starting my software engineering career. However...there are a few caveats.First, new students should know that you don’t magically get all these skills just because you get into the program. I found myself frustrated by a few of my peers who seemed more focused on socializing and just getting by in the assessments than studying and finishing all the projects and assignments. Because a lot of the learning happens in pairs, a weaker partner will compromise the learning opportunities of others. It also risks the reputation of the program as a whole. However, this was more the exception than the rule. Most students worked hard, demonstrated a real passion for programming, and took what a/A taught as a foundation for more self-directed learning, and in doing so became good developers that can build almost anything. Second, just being a strong developer doesn’t guarantee you a job interview. Especially in a market weary of bootcampers. That part relies on a lot of networking and luck and doing extra side projects. So the job search is a demoralizing, grueling process to get your foot in the door. Once you get your technical or onsite, though, you’ll find that App Academy has prepared you well. Pros: - well-designed curriculum that builds incrementally on learning- teaches the most up-to-date technologies/libraries/frameworks- good balance of lectures, hands-on projects, videos, take-home assignments- reasonable hours for a bootcamp (9am-6pm, + 2-3 hours of homework) - gives a good foundation in algorithms, web architecture, and other skills necessary for interviews- based on pair programming and collaborative skills- good job search guidance for how to craft your resume, frame your past experiences, etc. - deferred tuition model reflects how much the program is invested in making you a good, employable developer- progressive values and mindset, encourages diversity and inclusiveness for all backgroundsCons: - bootcamps in general have a bad rap these days, so it seems to be a more challenging than before for grads get interviews - less rigorous screening and assessments process for students may hurt reputation in the long run- didn’t feel particularly close to my cohort or staff, but like I mentioned, that was less of a priority for me- growing student numbers might compromise quality of training in the future - some TA’s are less knowledgeable than others, but you’ll always get the help and guidance you need- there’s now more structure and support during the job search process than previous cohorts, but it’s still not enough- paying back a large percentage of salary can end up being more than other schools’ tuition if you end up getting a really good offer.

Read More since you are reading this review, you are thinking the same thing. Once I decided that I was invested in making this transition, and a bootcamp was the best way for me to make the change, I began to compare various programs and the main thing that differed App Academy from the others was their payment plan. Due to the time requirements for all these programs (80+ hours a week) it is pretty unrealistic to expect to keep any resemblance of a job/income and living in NYC without one is pretty tough to do. App Academy helps remedy this by not requiring any payment (other than a security deposit) until you land that first job. Not only did this make living in an expensive city with no job more do-able but also gives them a horse in the race” when you start your job hunt. This includes continuous interview prep of white boarding, alumni Q&amp;A, review/critique of your portfolio (resume, cover letter, GitHub/coding projects, personal website, and LinkedIn profile) as well as an in-house job fair at the end of your cohort.Regarding the curriculum I found that while interviewing, most companies are not looking for you to know a certain stack but have the ability to learn a new stack (if needed) based on what you already know. Most bootcamps offer a full stack curriculum in order to give you the needed marketable skills to prove you confidently know what you should and that you can learn something new if needed, and App Academy is no different. When I attended, the stack was Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Javascript, Backbone.js, jQuery, HTML, and CSS and since then they have updated to React.js instead of Backbone.js, but don’t worry, all new material is available to you as alumni so that you can use it if you would like to learn a new framework. Like anything you do, you will get what you put in and App Academy gives you everything you need in order to succeed and become qualified in all the topics you cover. From day one you will need to properly prepare for the interview process where you will complete online exams, a live coding challenge, and a live interview; and the testing doesn\'t end there. To make sure that everyone is where they need to be so that no student is disadvantaged while pair programming there are (bi)-weekly exams that you must pass in order to continue with the program. Preparing for this will include hours of studying and practice on the weekends and after class… this will definitely be 80+ hours a week. All of this is not to discourage you because if you really expect to become proficient in so many languages in such a short amount of time, this is the only way to do it. If you are ready to put in the time for 4 months and 100% sold on becoming a developer I think that App Academy will be perfect for you.TL:DR - App Academy offers a comparable stack/curriculum to other bootcamps with everything you need to succeed if you are really 100% committed to the program. It WILL be 80+ hours a week to get by and pass their weekly progress exams and 100+ if you want to really excel at everything.

I did a lot of research and applied to many of the major boot camps offering \'similar\' curriculums. I was accepted to a few including Dev Bootcamp and Flatiron School. All of the boot camps say that their curriculum is geared towards people with no experience, so anyone can do it. That\'s a bit misleading as they all will expect you to demonstrate some logical competency and a basic understanding of how to problem solve programmatically in the interview. I spent about 6 months practicing on sites like codeschool.com and codewars.com before I began applying. In the end, I selected a/A for two reasons: their tuition structure (pay after you get a job), and because I found their application process to be the most difficult. I applied 3 times before I was accepted to a/A, vs. my first try at the other schools.During:My brother is a Marine and had a great time ribbing me about going to a \'boot camp\' for obvious reasons. But I have to say, although there are not pushups, calling it a boot camp isn\'t far off. It is very, very hard, and the hours are long. Again, I never graduated college, so my basis for comparison might be skewed, but even people in my cohort with degrees ranging from BAs to PhDs acknowledged that it was a difficult program. The style of teaching at a/A is to show you a thing once, then give you instructions and a day to replicate it with a partner, with the TAs on hand to assist. They will not give you direct answers (for the most part) but rather guide you through the all-important process of debugging and figuring out problems on your own. It\'s challenging, and at times very frustrating, but ultimately the system teaches you how to be a self-reliant developer.After:In 5 months I went from being a bartender with no college degree to a well-paid full-stack (actual job title, not just a buzz word) web developer at a company that I\'m very excited about. Most graduates (so far, from my class) landed an initial salary between 90 and 100k. Another concern I had going in was that a/A teaches Ruby on Rails, which some developers will tell you isn\'t the most relevant language these days. That\'s BS. Developers love to be opinionated about the tech that they work with, and you will be too eventually. I love Rails, but I can say objectively that it\'s more about learning how a server is structured than the specific syntax you are using. The knowledge that I got from a/A felt tech agnostic by the time I reached the job hunt; language is a nonissue. Anyways, there are definitely a lot of Rails specific developer positions out there if that\'s the route you decide to go. The job hunt is a bit intense, but there are designated a/A staff members to help you along the way.

The program its self is nothing short of amazing, in my opinion its the ideal model for education. Expert teachers, helpful TAs, and a well rounded and diverse group of smart and enthusiastic peers who are just as eager to learn as you are. The peer interaction is one of the best parts of the program, you can easily learn as much if not more from your peers as you will from the lectures and reading. The BEST and most unique part of app academy is the tuition model (no tuition until you find a job, at which you pay a % of your first year salary over time) . This is crucial and something you can not find in any other boot camp that I have ever come across. The fact that they do not get paid until you find a job means that your incentives are aligned with theirs. They have every reason to make the curriculum the best that it can be, and they will support and advise you until you find a job. This also means that you dont have to shell up $10K or more up front like you would with other boot camps and there is no risk if thing don\'t work out.I learned a tremendous amount and made a lot of friends during the program, many of which I am still in touch with today. I attended app academy in October of 2013 and I now work for groupon making 2.5x as much as I made before I was a software dev.

The program is far from perfect. It\'s growing faster than it can adapt, leading to problems:1) Instructor quality varies. There are great lecturers (some of whom have already left since my relatively recent graduation), and there are mediocre lecturers. There are also just straight bad lecturers.1a) If you rely completely on lecture to learn and understand the material, you\'re doomed anyways. That\'s not the point of a bootcamp.2) Project quality varies. Some of them were honestly mind-blowing. Like, whoa...that\'s how that works, holy shit, I get it-type projects. Some of them are filler (learning how to do authentication 4 times is an example of teaching to a test, which in a short curriculum, is probably not the best use of time).3) TAs are usually high-performing students. That\'s good, if you want to learn from people who graduated shortly before you. It\'s good for the ratio, but they aren\'t always able to help you.4) Job search curriculum makes up 3 weeks of the total 12. In some ways, it was really helpful: whiteboarding, working on projects, and dedicated application time were all helpful! Fuzzy you can do it! lectures, ghostly job seeker counselors that were frequently out and less frequently helpful (though encouraging, which is fine), and a general head-in-the-sand approach to the glut of junior (and specifically bootcamp grad) developers out there were all kinda downers, considering this was a quarter of the total course. Increasing the required application # from 100 to 200 is not a good strategy to combat a rapidly saturating market.BUT - to bring it back to where I started: it does work. You just have to be aware of the limitations of the program so you can make up for them with your personal efforts. Self-teach extensively before considering a bootcamp. Being top 50% isn\'t really good enough for bootcamp grads anymore (if you want to get a job quickly).

After some research, I decided a/A was the one for me, largely due to the pricing structure and an excellent review from a friend of a friend that had recently attended. Let me go off on a tangent here and rave about the pricing structure. If you\'re not aware, App Academy charges nothing up front (although there is a deposit). You don\'t pay anything until you get a job and then once you do get a job, you pay a percentage of your salary. This unique model is incredibly fair, allows someone like myself who couldn\'t afford other bootcamps to attend, and says a lot about what a/A offers. With this model, a/A would completely fail if what they were offering was anything less than high quality.The application process was very challenging and took a bit longer than I expected. The process includes interviews and several coding challenges but you are not penalized for the time it takes to get through it all. a/A even provides a whole bunch of rich materials that, with enough review and practice, should be sufficient enough for one to get through the challenges. This says a lot about a/A\'s integrity and accessibility. a/A has high acceptance standards, but if you are willing to put in the work there\'s a good chance you\'ll get in, and a/A wants to help you be successful in doing so. In fact, I didn\'t pass the last coding challenge, but since I was close to a solution I was given more material to go through and a second chance.a/A kicked off at full speed. I was expecting the program to be challenging and a whole lot of work, and I experienced exactly that. Days typically consisted of a lecture in the early morning led by the instructors where we went over the previous days assignments, went through demos, had a Q&amp;A etc. Then we jumped into the days assignments which would take up most of the rest of the afternoon and often the evening. Most days we pair programmed, which was much more fun (and less lonely) than my programming journey had been up until this point. Seeing others\' approaches to problems was also very insightful. At night we were expected to go over the solutions to the days problems and do the reading for the following day. We had nearly weekly programming assessments that were often very difficult, primarily due to not being able to use any resources. I hated the assessments due to the stress they brought me, but they did force us to develop a deep understanding of key concepts. However, even with regular stresses and working upwards of 100 hours a week, my time at a/A was very enjoyable. The instructors were incredible resources (I wish I took more advantage of this) and I made a ton of great friends. I have no shortage of fond memories from this period of my life and I was pretty bummed to see it end.I can\'t recommend App Academy enough. I had a great time, the program is of the highest quality, and I couldn\'t be happier with the results I got. 3 months at App Academy (plus a few months in preparation) got me into a career that I\'m very happy to be in and my income has doubled. How can you beat that? Also, 6 months after completion my debt to a/A was completely fulfilled.

My cohort was exceptional -- I had less programming experience than many of my peers, but the curriculum moves so fast that students of all backgrounds were constantly challenged and engaged. Sometimes the speed and quantity of assessments felt overwhelming, but it is necessary if you want to learn something as complex as the fundamentals of web development in such a short period of time.

Instead, I want to focus on something that I didn\'t expect before joining app academy, and that is the culture of instruction. App Academy promotes itself as a rigorous program with great stats, but doesn\'t necessarily advertise culture, and this made me nervous going into the program (I really liked some other bootcamps\' focus on culture).

Basically, forget about picking where you want to work, just get an offer anywhere that will give you one because let\'s face it, we\'re in a coding bootcamp bubble.

My journey shortly ended after the second basic coding challenge. This sort of gives you a picture of how much coding experience I had going into the Prep course(not enough). My results after finishing the month long prep course changed a lot of things for me. Not only was I applying to other bootcamps I was getting into all of them. I got accepted into all of the bootcamps I applied to, and I applied to all of the hard ones including the notoriously competitive App Academy and Hack Reactor. The details of the course can be found on their website so I won\'t go into that here. The reason I say this course is all about you is because you have one month to get into the bootcamp of your dreams, put your all into it. If you\'re looking for a bootcamp prep course, I am assuming you already am ready to commit some 3 months of your life to flip it upside down. The same idea applies to this course, you have 1 month to make those 3 months a reality. Those 3 months bootcamps that you dreamt of, you can have your pick of the litter and make it your reality. There were three students that stood out to me in the course, myself included. One thing we had in common was that we did not have other time commitments. This does not mean you need to drop everything just yet. The course I took was part time accessible for a reason. The curriculum covered everything I was being tested on and more. As long as you grasp concepts and can write code accordingly, you will be in great shape. I assume the tests will only get harder as the years go by but I know App Academy is an adaptive school and I wouldn\'t be surprised if they adapt their curriculum as the times change. The Job Support is what I consider to be their application support. Coming out of this prep course you apply to bootcamps, not jobs, but I consider this to be the equivalent. It was good. There were extra materials to work on and mock interviews to be scheduled.I can\'t vouch for any other bootcamp prep courses. Even if the curriculum is the same, the experience could be completely different. I went to App Academy\'s Bootcamp Prep Course and I hit the jackpot. Things click for me. I\'m not a wiz, remember I failed after the second basic coding challenge, never mind the technical interview, but after the course I killed it all.I\'m confident that this course can do a lot for a lot of other people.

It was nice that I was able to go at my own pace and learn what I wanted to, but after some time, I knew that I wanted to accelerate my learning and find a position... Read More as a software engineer. Hence, after researching and reading many reviews, I applied to App Academy. After completing the technical interview with App Academy, I was accepted into the March cohort. I completed the 4 week prep work that was required prior to starting, and went in enthusiastic and ready to learn. For me, the course was a load of fun. From Monday - Friday, from 9 - 6 (with a 1 hour 15 minute lunch break and a 15 minute break), it was all about learning and coding. My personal schedule was to wake up at 6:00 AM, get to App Academy by 7:30 - 8:00 AM, and review the readings / homework assignment before class started at 9:00. After 6:00, I would look over the solution for the day\'s work, and prepare for the next day. I would usually go to bed by 10:30 PM, with the latest being 11:00 PM, as I believed getting enough sleep was the key to me being able to focus throughout the immense workload that App Academy entails. However, everyone in my cohort was different, so what worked for me might not have worked for someone else. Finding the balance and schedule that worked for me was key to keeping my momentum going and not get burnt out. The good news is, it was only for 3 months, so even though it was tough every day, it didn\'t continue for years. I did enjoy learning and coding constantly, and it was amazing how much I learned at the end of the curriculum, with a full-stack project that I am pretty damn proud of. I would actually look forward to Mondays, as it was another day to continue to grow my skill set and build cool things. The most stressful part was probably the assessments. The policy at App Academy is that you are only allowed to fail 1 out of the 6 given. If you fail two, you are released from the program. That\'s why it is important to keep on top of the material, and make sure you have a deep understanding of the concepts that are taught. They do provide practice assessments that closely follow the actual assessment, though they are different, so you can\'t just memorize the practice assessment. It is highly recommended that you take the month-long prep work that is given before the start of the main course seriously, as everything from the curriculum builds on top of it.The part I enjoyed least was the job searching process. While App Academy does provide lectures about algorithms for technical interview questions, I found it very difficult to get through the resume screening to even get a chance for a phone screen. My other classmates had more success than me though, so I might have just been an unusual case. They tell you it\'s a numbers game, and that you have to apply to many to get a few hits. It was tiring and demoralizing, but I eventually got through it and landed a job. I would recommend saving enough money to last you not only the 3 months of the main curriculum, but also for the job search process as well, as the amount of time it takes to find a job is uncertain. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at App Academy. You are surrounded by motivated and talented individuals, and everyone is working together to get through it. You are challenged to learn a crap load of information everyday, and you will be amazed at what you can achieve in a short amount of time. Without App Academy, I would not have been confident to even apply to software engineering jobs.Read Less','app-academy'),(2078,243193,'Decent engineering curriculum, rock-bottom terrible network and job search','2016-07-13',0,2.7,2,5,1,'Pros: Paid out of salary, hence only a small upfront layout ($5k, and they\'re flexible if that\'s difficult, though it wasn\'t for me).Good coverage of basics of Rails; I was there before they switched to React, but the Backbone.JS we did was also solid...

You should be aware, however, that to do well in it, you\'re going to need to dedicate another hour or two to it. I spent an average of 4-5 hours a day on it, completing assignments and reading the lecture notes beforehand.Other things that might be of particular interest: (1) You\'re free to use either Windows, OSX, or Linux. (I used Windows.) However, FYI most coding bootcamps require a Mac for their full stack web development courses. (2) You might be wondering, why does the prep course teach JavaScript? That\'s because most bootcamps let (or require) you to interview in JavaScript. (3) The course has an online discussion forum, set up via a website called Piazza. Since the course itself runs in parallel with the bootcamp prep courses in other areas, you can ask for help from other bootcamp prep instructors and students from across the nation. (The course was only set up in SF and NY when I took it, but it now seems like more locations have opened.) (4) If you\'re taking this course to get into App Academy\'s full stack web development course, you get to skip the pre-challenge and move straight to a 45-min technical interview.Overall, the bootcamp prep course is a big investment, but it will increase your chances of getting in a top bootcamp. I worked through the practice exercises for the technical interview for App Academy\'s full stack web development course, and I believe that I was able to solve all of them due to the fact that I had acquired the logical thinking required through constant coding at Bootcamp Prep.

At the end of the first week, we built Tic Tac Toe allowing human players to play through the terminal against an unbeatable AI in 8 hours (that was nuts!). A few weeks later we took 5 days to learn all the same things in Javascript. Many of the junior programmers I\'ve interviewed from other camps knew a lot of ways to do things with Rails, but didn\'t know how to script well enough in plain old Ruby/JS.AA taught object-oriented and social programming. Our code was constantly evaluated for object-oriented thinking, clarity in choice of variable and function names, and accessibility to other programmers. Really handy now when I\'m working with 6 other engineers!AA taught away the magic. AA\'s instructors taught this super well - nothing is magical. In the course we did things like rebuild Active Record through meta programming, recreate the basics of Backbone.js using plain Javascript, implement our own sessions/login before using Devise/Sorcery, read server logs to detect and get rid of N+1 queries, and other things that dig deeper into frameworks that many take for granted.They know what companies are looking for. I was fortunate enough to get 5 offers in 4 weeks of searching after AA. They really prepared me for the job search.ConsAA\'s curriculum covers less overall material. I think the course was a little too light on coverage of CSS. We also didn\'t cover some classic Rails patterns, like making forms work through AJAX with Rails\' forms using remote: true ( we did cover how to AJAXify through plain old JS, obviously). Finally, I wish we had spent more time learning to code through TDD. It\'s a tradeoff for focusing more deeply.AA is extremely fast-paced. You have to work hard to keep up. Definitely reminded me of \'drinking from the firehose\' in my MIT days. Your brain will hurt a lot. You will stress over keeping up and doing the homework after coding for 10 hours straight.

I was told it would take 9 months at 3hrs/day of school work. However it took me close to a year at around 5-8 hours/day to complete all of the assignments. I think the timeline to complete the curriculum is dependent on several factors, including your mentor\'s dedication to your learning, the complexity of capstone projects you choose and your experience with design when entering into the program. In retrospect I would suggest anyone considering this course to expect to spend at least twice as much time getting through it. Additionally, it helps to have a base knowledge or working experience with design when starting the curriculum, though it\'s not necessary, it\'ll save you a lot of time. Lastly, the mentor you\'re paired with is crucial to your success. I was lucky that my mentor was willing to go above and beyond our weekly 30min call times. If it wasn\'t for my mentor taking more of a teaching role I would not have been as successful or feel as prepared as I do now.

Read More of the curriculum is actually videos and articles from other online resources (see Cons below). But they make up for this by their mentorship program (see Pros below). On the surface, this looks like a really good deal--it\'s cheaper than other bootcamps, it\'s self-paced, and you get a tuition refund guarantee if you don\'t find a job within 6 months of graduating. However, in practice, when you have a 6-month deadline (instead of in-person classes with an instructor to keep you accountable on a daily basis), it can be really easy to fall behind. Fortunately Springboard has a number of student advisors and other support staff who can help with setting a schedule for you to follow and giving you extensions (both of which I\'ve used). But I think the people who can best thrive in this kind of program are those who can set clear goals for themselves on a weekly basis, in spite of all the other things going on in their lives. I had a lot of trouble balancing my bootcamp assignments with my daytime job and family obligations (your job and familial needs will feel very immediate while the bootcamp feels less urgent because of the 6-month deadline), and I quickly fell behind and needed extensions. This might all sound very obvious, but it\'s something that I and others I know often overlook. If you\'re not the kind of person to set hard deadlines for yourself, don\'t do a self-paced bootcamp. But if you are, and you don\'t mind not having an in-person instructor, then Springboard is for you. Pros: The mentorship program is the highlight of this bootcamp. Every student is matched with a mentor who they meet with once per week, 30 minutes at a time. You can also schedule additional unlimited 1:1 mentor calls with any mentor that\'s available, but I\'ve found my weekly mentor to be the biggest help. I was able to ask my mentor for guidance on capstone projects, discuss questions I had about the mathematics behind certain algorithms, and ask for career advice (they are people in the industry, so they have insight on the field and job searches and whatnot). Springboard also has career coaches to help us with job searches, but it\'s still helpful to hear directly from the mouth of a person in the industry. Cons: Much of the curriculum is material that you can find on your own online (like articles on medium.com). Springboard organizes it all into a nice package for you, with many of their own project assignments sprinkled throughout, but this can make some of the material feel disjointed since it\'s a conglomeration of many different sources put together. Springboard goes through many updates with their curriculum though, so they\'ve been making improvements to their assignments and curricula. To sum it up: you get what you pay for; Springboard is one of the more affordable bootcamps, but they\'re able to keep the price low by not building their whole curriculum from scratch and instead using other resources already available on the web.Read Less','springboard'),(2106,276074,'Learned a lot!

It took a lot out of me and there were multiple times I burned out. I put a lot of importance in the Industry Design Program and I was disappointed. Most companies that you get matched up with probably would not use your designs at the end (I know some students have had their designs implemented). This all comes down to the company as most do not have the financial budget to hire someone to implement your designs. But maybe they will in the future.

People in the beginning were very active and now it\'s like there are crickets in some channels.

I always had an interest in data but never felt confident in acting on it until I had to figure out my next step after teaching. I studied... Read More international relations and communication/writing in my undergraduate career so had no formal quantitative experience upon applying. From the moment I applied to Springboard, everything was incredibly professional and straightforward. In fact, after submitting my application, a recruiter called me within 5 minutes to talk about my interest - completely opposite of another boot camp I was considering who didn’t even contact me despite confirming an appointment. This quickness made me think they were desperate, but the recruiter wasn’t pushy but friendly and even gave me an informal interview to make sure I was someone who really wanted to sign up. After that call, I was required to take a roughly one-hour long quantitative aptitude test to further verify that data analytics was a path I could reasonably pursue. I mention this because I was worried that I would fall trap to simply enrolling into a program that took anyone and everyone who signed up. In truth, I’m not sure if they decline students from enrolling either way, but I felt confident that this interview and assessment were evidence that they were at least slightly selective in their admissions process. Curriculum The curriculum is mostly a curation of online resources. These resources come from YouTube videos, articles, and other websites related to business and data analytics. A couple of units are specifically dedicated to business education like economics, financial analysis, statistics, accounting, and other business fundamentals. The cycle of the projects also follows that of a typical data analyst workflow, somewhat similar to the scientific method in crafting a hypothesis, gathering data, exploration, etc. I found these concepts helpful as I was someone who steered away from anything business-related up to that point; I simply had no interest back then. Most of the projects simulate a real-world project utilizing the things you learned earlier in the unit. These are not typically from online resources and are created by Springboard. Given that I don’t have real-world experience with these kinds of projects, it’s hard for me to stack them up against practicality, but they tended to help structure my capstone projects which require you to make up your own project and find the data for it, so it was helpful in that regard. Otherwise, sometimes the projects were poorly worded and it could be slightly cumbersome in finding out exactly what you were supposed to do. But these were usually minor and you could always clarify with your mentor or other students about the assignments and get clarification. They also release new versions of the curriculum to improve a particular assignment, section, or even whole unit based on student feedback so they really try to be responsive to what’s working and what’s not for students. Towards the final stages of the curriculum, you’re required to do a series of interviews that would mimic a real interview you would get. For example, you do a behavioral interview, a presentation interview in which you create a presentation from a project in the course and give that presentation as if you were “working” for the organization, and a technical interview in which they ask you questions about statistics, business, SQL, or whatever else might come up in a real technical interview. Your career coach helps you prepare for these, mostly the behavioral ones as they aren’t data specialists themselves but you can also do preparation with your mentor to prepare for these. They are pass/fail. You’re given a couple of opportunities to pass it but if you fail too many times then you have to redo a couple of units I believe. At first, I found this kind of scary, but the pressure it adds to those interviews is really helpful in simulating what it will be like when you’re doing real interviews. They tend to be anxiety-inducing, you’ll be nervous, and the stakes are higher. The fact that they try to build this pressure into these mock interviews was pretty cool now that I reflect on it. At the time I didn’t think it was that cool! But if you’re someone who struggles with interviews, these mock runs are helpful not only in getting practice but also feedback from those interviewers. They go into detail about how you could do better or other things to think about when you get to a real interview. Mentors and Community Each student is assigned a mentor who is a data analyst/scientist in the field. You have weekly calls with them and they’re mostly there to guide you through the curriculum but you can always talk to them about other things like job searching or how they use tools/techniques in their own jobs, etc; at least my mentor was open to talking about whatever. I hadn’t ever come across anyone who had a bad experience with their mentor, but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. My mentor was incredibly relaxed, easy to talk to, and helpful when I needed help in the curriculum or needed encouragement on something I found difficult. One thing that made me like my mentor more was also his ability to sometimes question minor details in the curriculum. I appreciate someone who can point out weaknesses in something even though they’re part of the organization itself. It let me know that this person I was assigned to by Springboard wasn’t necessarily a 100% kool-aid drinking member of the club, but an independent person who, though still agreed the curriculum was a good one, was capable of sometimes saying “well I’m not sure I would do it that way but it’s valid.” Upon being accepted into the program, you are also invited to the Slack channel for your specific course. This is where you can communicate with other students in the course who are all at different stages of the curriculum, though you do have a channel for people who are in your specific cohort. There are also Springboard faculty in the channel as well, including a person who helped write the curriculum. They are really helpful in clarifying kinks in assignments or helping students who are having a difficult time on something. There are also various channels for different types of things like job searching, motivation, resources, recorded lectures, and all types of things. Throughout the curriculum, you also have career units in which you learn strategies about job searching. You’re also allowed to choose a career coach, who appears to be contracted with Springboard (I could be wrong about this) to provide 30-minute coaching sessions. These range from resume critiques, to mock interviews, to general strategies, to sharing resources, and really anything that they feel would be helpful to you. You also aren’t required to stick with one career coach, you can always select from a whole list of people at any point and they have descriptions of their background to give you a sense of what to expect. I stuck with the same one the entire time because I didn’t feel the need to talk to a different coach. The Job Search The job search process was not a totally pleasant one, as anyone who has gone through it can attest. But my career coach and the Springboard community in Slack were really helpful. You could see where other people were struggling as well and my career coach would always give helpful suggestions or resources to help in my search. I applied to a little over 90 jobs and had 3 total interviews. Again, I don’t have any kind of formal background in data, business, or STEM besides the Springboard certificate and some projects to showcase my aptitude, so I felt that that was a bit of a barrier for me. Despite this, I did get a job! A friend of my partner referred me to a role at her company which landed me the interview. My career coach did a mock interview with me, reviewed Google Docs that I drafted interview responses to, and answered any other questions I had during the process. I can honestly say my experience in the boot camp really gave me a leg up. They loved that I had that experience and projects to show for it. During the final round of interviews for this role, I had a technical assessment and didn’t do too hot on it, but I was able to redeem myself by talking intelligently about my projects in the course. I think this made me come across as someone who understood general concepts and use cases for specific things and even if I lagged on the technical assessment, I was someone who could get better quickly. My title isn’t “data analyst” but “marketing specialist.” Much of the role is data related though and even though some of it isn’t, it allows me to use skills that I’ve built over the years in undergrad and as a teacher so I’m not 100% shifted into a totally new technical profession. The other roles I interviewed for were pure data analyst jobs though. I made it to either the final or next to final rounds in those interviews and made some mistakes that I think cost me the job. You learn from these though, and your career coach will help you diagnose what happened and how you can do better the next time. I finished the course in mid-November and just recently got a job offer on March 29, so a little over 4 months after completing the course. Another cool thing that Springboard offers is post-completion assistance. You’re allowed to meet with another mentor who can help you be accountable for keeping your skills alive and building more projects to showcase to prospective employers. You have access to this mentor until you get a job and can be really helpful when you complete the course and then start to find that your skills are slipping. A Potential Downside One potential downside to this track might be the curriculum. Though this downside is innate in the way the course is structured. It’s set up as a part-time, 6-month learning experience. They want you to get familiar with a wide range of tools that you could potentially use in a data analyst job, mostly the more popular ones as there are TONS of tools that you could potentially use in the field. In this regard, there’s more breadth than depth in the things you’ll learn. They are still helpful. After a unit and a project, you can honestly say that you’re proficient in that tool or concept. You’ll also learn that each tool could be its own 6-month course. If you haven’t used Microsoft Excel professionally before, or maybe you have, you find out that Excel is more powerful than what you were familiar with. This was the case for me anyway. I’m not sure that any boot camp can really overcome this downside though when the curriculum itself is designed to be completed in a relatively short period of time. You might become interested in diving deeper into a tool after completing a unit on it, but have to move on to the next tool introduced in the next unit. This is just part of being in tech. I recommend seeking other online resources if you become really interested in getting better at a particular tool. However, I still believe, along with many other practitioners, that the curriculum is still helpful in allowing you to understand the essentials and then get a job with them. In Conclusion I think the number one thing that you get out of the course is structure and community. Of course, you could learn everything in any boot camp online for free, but you to be someone who can muster the discipline and structure to stick to it long-term. I have a habit of constantly looking for new resources to learn from, even after finding what seems like a good one, I’ll complete half of it and then start looking for something else. Springboard’s curriculum allowed me to stay on course and I trusted that what they put in front of me was going to be helpful in learning and ultimately getting a job. The frequent connection with my mentors, career coach, and other students was really helpful in knowing that I wasn’t alone. It gave me a psychological edge in that someone I was meeting with at the end of the week was expecting me to complete assignments and be able to discuss them.

Since curriculum is broad and covers many different topics in world of data science, many of which are changing quickly as technologies change, the curriculum constantly needs updating which is tough to keep on top of. There are, however, mechanisms to provide feedback on curriculum, and the Slack community is always super helpful. The topics covered include a wide range in data science, so it\'s a balancing act to get the right balance of breadth vs depth. At times it felt like there was just too much information to absorb.Read Less','springboard'),(2163,274305,'The mentors are wonderful, and make the program.','2021-03-04',0,4.5,5,4,5,'In searching for the right Data Science bootcamp, mentorship was the most important element to me: I needed to connect with someone who was able to help me master coding, thinking in data science, and the cutting-edge innovations happening in the field,... Read More while bearing in mind my background in philosophy and interest in AI Ethics: Rigor in the field, plus a way to tie it to the mental model I already had about the world. I was lucky to have found a mentor (Ben!) who did exactly that in my time at Springboard. Especially great, too, is their unlimited mentors option -- a half hour/day, every day, for the entire time you\'re part of the program. I used that liberally to cover the gaps, ask deeper questions, and find resources that were off-curriculum. Springboard\'s curriculum is mostly public-domain, and I appreciated most of the resources they provided. DataCamp isn\'t very helpful to learning to code, in the end (try learning French only by being given full sentences, with a single word missing in each sentence you have to fill in -- not gonna happen). The notebooks they provided were mostly good. Sometimes they were unhelpful to learning this or that concept, although the team was rapid to help out. Here\'s my recommendation to Springboard: Give the option for students to do e.g. four capstones after Unit 6 (the guided capstone they have us do), rather than walk through the whole curriculum. If they opt to do four capstones, make the rest of the curriculum optional -- they\'d simply be resources to help students out on their capstones. The capstones would then have to be approach-specific, e.g. do a capstone that works with a time series, or NLP, in order to get credit for the capstone. I suggest this because I find that I learned a LOT when I worked on my capstones, because they related to topics I cared about, and sincerely wanted to understand -- more, in fact, than I ever did plodding through DataCamp or lectures that didn\'t necessarily interest me. I think that\'d also be better for student portfolios -- it shows they\'re self-motivated and can actively produce multiple projects on a diverse array of subjects/problems within Data Science. Just my two cents. IMO it\'s an idea worth piloting. I didn\'t graduate through their job guarantee (or get a job ultimately related to data science), so I\'ve left the Job Support section blank. Overall, extremely grateful to have gone through the program. I learned a lot and I know I\'ll apply my knowledge in unexpected places &amp; ways.

At the end, I got the opportunity to do a project in a proper company and get the feel of utilising what I learnt in the course to solve a real-life company problem. I have to admit, despite doing the huge capstone, I was still scared, wondering What If I am not able to solve their problem or what If I do things that might be embarrassing. But the mentors and student advisors were there every step of the way calming my rapidly beating heart. But once I got into the company, things just came out smoothly, that\'s when I truly started appreciating the course on how well it prepared me to do this job, and thoroughly enjoying it during the process. All this I was able to do while having a baby and taking care of him afterwards. That\'s another reason I am glad I chose Springboard. Once I became pregnant after the course, I had only 6 months time to finish it, but I was gonna have a baby and everything. Thats when I reached out to Springboard telling them my concerns. Not only did they take my situation into consideration, but understood my predicament, and tailored the course around my schedule so that I may complete the course and start applying for a job. They told me, they understand how difficult it would be for a person who is having a baby, take care of them, and come back into the job market. Which is why, they would like to help me in anyway to prepare me to get a job. For that I am filled with gratitude.

However, I believe there are a few things they can still improve on.Pros:- Overall Quality: the data science track definitely introduces and educates you well to the data science world, used in the industry. It covers most aspects of data science (wrangling, visualization, ML, ... ) and lets you acquire enough experience to land a job in that field. Of course, it won\'t replace extensive years of professional experience, but it is great way to bootstrap your data science career.- Preparedness: I would argue that the data science track doesn\'t require advanced programming skills, but it is best to have some Python experience (the software overwhelmingly used in the course). If you don\'t (like me), the first few months can be a bit of a learning curve. You eventually pass that stage though.- The Capstone Projects: the program is focused on two data science projects that you lead from start to finish. A great learning experience where you put your hands in the dirt, which you accomplish under the supervision of your mentor. These are great accomplishments you put in your portfolio and that you showcase to employers. - Mentorship: Speaking of which, the supervision by your mentor is probably the greatest feature of the course (and why the price is a bit high). For those who need someone to look over their shoulder, it\'s definitely a great resource that helps you move forward in the course. The mentorship I received was great and from what I heard, bad experience with mentors is quite rare. Plus you can always change, if it gets really bad.- Career: The career services they offer are equally useful. By helping you build your résumé, your LinkedIn profile, etc... Springboard helps you reach out and makes your profile more attractive to employers. The mock interviews you need to pass in order to complete the course are ideal reflections of real career situations.- Flexibility: While it is not something obvious when you start, you can actually ask for pauses, freezes and extensions if you need more time to complete the curriculum, or if you dealing with too much stuff a time in your professional / personal life (I assume they don\'t openly advertise that because they prefer you to finish the certification in a reasonable amount of time). I personally extensively used those (mostly because of how busy I was with my Ph.D. work, specially when it came down to my thesis defense). I eventually completed the program in 12 months. However, I DO NOT recommend to do so within such a big time frame. 6-8 months is definitely reasonable if you allocate the proper time each week. If you trail like I did, Springboard eventually starts charging you for additional extensions.Cons:- Rates: their rates are a bit high in my opinion and I believe it\'s mostly because of the number of resources they offer (mentors, career advisors, extensive curriculum, access to external resources like DataCamp). It\'s good to have that many resources, but in my opinion, some parts of the curriculum (maybe less than 10%) are useless or redundant. Therefore, I think the rates (assuming you avoid enrolling in paid extensions) could be 10% cheaper than what they currently are.- Customer Service: this definitely has been the worst part of the whole program. I assume it\'s because Springboard has considerably increased its volume of students (across all tracks) but their personnel\'s size hasn\'t keep up with the trend. While I always eventually obtained the information I requested, it takes a while to find and reach out to the proper person. First of, they only allow email communications. Then, their services are split between advisors, support team, finance team, etc... So if you ask for something to someone, they will most likely re-direct you to someone else. And the response time can be a few days. I don\'t expect every customer rep. to know everything and I assume it takes a while to train, but it is quite frustrating when you can\'t get a straight answer immediately, specially for finance-related questions or for deadlines (when you need an answer fast).Read Less','springboard'),(2350,268551,'amazing experience','2020-09-17',0,5,5,5,5,'I didn\'t find any cons for sure.

Read More I could not have learned what I did in this course without his help) - Additional mentor calls if necessary (these aren\'t with your mentor, but with a different mentor assigned by Springboard. I still found them helpful) - The structure of the course helps you really understand the basics and have a good foundation for the fundamentals of UX design - The Industry Design Project! Huge strong point. This will give you real-world experience which you can put on your resume and highlight on your portfolio - If you take the job guarantee, you\'re required to pass mock interviews at the end of the course: whiteboarding, portfolio walkthrough, and a behavioral interview. You get two chances to pass, but I passed them all on my first try and so did the other students I spoke with. As long as you prepare and practice you should be able to pass, but this is a strong point because it prepares you for the real-world interview process. I was really nervous for these but I\'m very glad they\'re embedded into the structure of the course - I have just applied to complete with Springboard, so I haven\'t begun my job search yet, but if you take the job guarantee you will also have access to career coaches 6 months post-graduation, which will be incredibly valuable - My student advisor (Molly) was incredible - quick response from her when I reached out, and she went above and beyond to address my concerns and make sure I was taken care of Sticking points (for me personally): - The course ran a lot longer than I expected it to. The projected time to complete is within 6 months if you spend 20-25 hours a week on the course. It took me about 11 months to complete, and I think this is more due to the course structure than anything else. Projects build on other projects, so sometimes I had to revise certain projects before moving onto the next stage. For the lengthier projects, I had to revise multiple times and it took a few weeks to get the go ahead from my mentor to continue. Like I said, he was incredibly helpful to me outside of the normal hours we met and I don\'t blame him for this at all - I think it made me a much better designer and helped me to go into the material in more depth. My sticking point here is just wishing that Springboard projected closer to a year rather than 6 months (for part-time students like me), but this could be something that\'s unique to my experience - I understand why the career coaching sections are built into the structure of the course, but I have to admit I really did just want to focus on the hard skills of the course and found it a little jarring that there were career coaching sections in the beginning/middle of the course rather than just the end. The reason for this is networking and building up your LinkedIn profile/connections during the course, so the reasoning is good. I just struggled with feeling like I really wanted to focus on the skills themselves before doing the networking Overall, I had a really positive experience with Springboard and found that they were really helpful and responsive when I needed them to be.

I took their Software Engineering Career Track Prep course in order to get a strong basis for the main course. This course had a lot of good coverage on introductory subjects like standard CSS,... Read More Javascript, and HTML. I have taken a number of college courses on these subjects beforehand and didn\'t struggle with the prep material at all. I also really enjoyed the teacher: Colt Steele. You can Google his name and get a nice summary of his accomplishments with Rithm School (in-person Bootcamp in San Francisco). My issues with the program started around Section 12-13. While the earlier sections are easy enough to understand, that almost everyone won\'t struggle with them, once you get into more complex topics....the issues with Springboard become more glaring. Colt does a great job at breaking down subjects in the videos and keeps things interesting with fun jokes and a lighthearted approach to learning Web Development. The real issues seem to be with the supporting material and structure that Springboard itself provides. You meet with a mentor once a week for 30 minutes where you can\'t really accomplish all that much besides discuss a few issues you are currently having with your code. I actually like my mentor a lot, but they aren\'t supposed to be there to support you constantly as you work through the various projectsassignments. Instead, you are asked to reach out to the TA\'s, which Springboard states are available via chat and email throughout the day. This is a lie. There are really only 1-2 actual TA\'s that respond via email and on my experience the chat option is really only available around 5% of the time. So after you type up the issue you are experiencing, you just wait for a response, whether you needed a quick 5 word reply on something, or an extremely complex explanation with multiple paragraphs, it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours to get a response. There are no 1 on 1 virtual sessions where a TA would join a Zoom call and work with you individually to track down issues. Instead you upload code to Google Drive and wait for them to download and par-ruse your uploaded code. Also the sections are setup in a really weird fashion. You are expected to watch 10+ videos all at once per section (each ranging from 5-20 minutes), and then work through exercises at the end, which could cover something you learned in the second video over 2 hours previously. Instead of re-enforcing important subjects along the way (and no, coding along with Colt does not count as exercises Springboard :) ). It ends up being extremely hard for individuals to have a feeling of cohesiveness between the instructional videos and actual assignments. It comes across as lazy and unconventional for a school you are spending $8,000-$12,000 to attend. My wife attended Flatiron and I recommend that bootcamp far above Springboard (as far as web development is concerned, I know they are solid on the data science front from what I have read). Pros:-Colt Steele is a really good teacher, but can move a bit fast for some I imagine. -Material is presented with very modern tools, frameworks, and methodologies. -Fully online so you can do it from anywhere -Online Slack community of other students, though it isn\'t very active. Cons: -Extreme lack of assistance when working on larger projectsassessments. Just wait till you get to the Hack and Snooze app...oof. -TA\'s are basically non-existent. -Office hours are usually clogged with 20-30 students that are all working on completely different parts of the curriculum and getting questions in for your specific needs is near impossible. -Coding along with Colt during lessons is not good enough for reinforcement of complex topics. -Career Prep is essentially updating LinkedIn, Attending virtual events, and updating your resume. -No Pair Programming :( -Springboard just telling you to check the solution for answers.

It\'s hard to be good at them all. The UX career track at Springboard will give you your fair share of experience in each until you come to understand what it is about UX that you are best at. For me, it\'s research and strategy. I can hold my own all the way through the design process, but I find the most joy thinking about the why\'s, and bringing insights into design. I like to solve problems on a systemic level.As for the course, it\'s a highly sufficient curriculum that has enabled me to feel confident as I continue to learn design. The program has well vetted UX mentors that are industry veterans and are quite successful. And, the team of career coaches I\'ve interacted with has been top quality. These people are true professionals and THEIR job is to get YOU a job. That\'s a promise.But, it\'s still all on you. Make no mistake. A career transition isn\'t for the feint of heart, especially design. The good thing is that we are makers, so you should never stop making something. Never stop learning, and be courageous. And, be prepared to work for free or below your \'paygrade\' (at first).I am currently working on various passion projects that I will add to my portfolio in addition to the three projects I completed through the Springboard curriculum. Be mindful, you who are reading this, that UX isn\'t something you stop learning. I know there is a lot of information out there, though, and it can be overwhelming. Springboard was a great pathway for me to understand UX in principle and in process. But, don\'t stop with what they give you or it won\'t be enough. With that foundation of knowledge and experience, I\'ve been able to further investigate principles I enjoy, and find methods that fit my needs and specific style. Springboard teaches design thinking, but there are other umbrellas of UX understanding such as CX and User-centered design, which Springboard introduces briefly.Being a problem solver, I revolve around the core of UX, which is finding pain points. I\'ve also incorporated a problem solving framework called customer jobs aka jobs to be done. I\'m also investigating systems thinking and system\'s diagramming to use in tandem. These are just examples of many different UX frameworks you can add to your metaphorical toolbelt. Just find what you gravitate to. It\'s equally important to spend time designing and working with others. Other designers are your allies, but don\'t get too caught up in trying to be everyone\'s friend. Building meaningful relationships means being professional first. Add value to get value. Be genuine and authentic, seriously. Just be you.Being you is very important because design interviews are really hard. You have to be tenacious the same as any jobsearch, but you are going to basically be auditioning many times during interview rounds. Jobs will want to see how you design and how you will work with their team. So, prepare well for the mock interviews, which are effectively the finals for the UX course, or you won\'t get the job guarantee that comes with the course, and you may not even get a job even after all that. But, without risk there is no reward. And, so long as you put 100% into your projects, you will be a confident enough designer to showcase your work in an interview.I found a home in design because of Springboard. I truly believe that. My first love is writing, and always will be. But, I couldn\'t pass up the opportunity to be a problem solver by trade. I used Springboard to get an idea I had off the ground, and I\'m so glad I did.

While I talked to my mentor about some of them, I never saw a single review in writing. I think this would be a great opportunity to discuss theory and practice code reviews.- Course material needs to be expanded in some key areas.  -Deployment was limited to one Github mini-project and a very high-level overview video. Graduating students should probably have some familiarity with Docker or other software for productionization. - Distributed computing was covered in just two sets of exercises. I\'d prefer if there were not just more material on the subject, but some more discussion of the underlying theory. - While this may have been a result of me taking the generalist track, I felt the material on deep learning was way too light. We were given only one optional exercise that worked with Keras, despite it being the easiest major DL framework to learn and the least likely to be implemented at scale.

The two capstone projects are definitely the strongest aspect of Springboard and the aspect that got me the furthest in the interview process. Having projects to talk about really helped me in my initial interviews. My mentor who helped me with my projects was really nice and helpful! One thing that is a little sketchy that you should be aware of before you join: as part of the job guarantee, you are required to pass several mock interviews, and you only get two chances to pass each one. This did not impact me, but it is not something that is disclosed before you start the bootcamp. I was pretty satisfied with Springboard’s curriculum, but what I was completely unprepared for was the competitiveness of the job market. It’s tough to get interviews with no experience, and when you do get interviews, you have to be perfect or they will just find someone more qualified than you. I struggled with technical interviews, particularly coding interviews and business interviews (business is not my background). The mentors that they have to help you prepare for technical interviews are not super helpful. The job guarantee makes it so that they have a reason to help you get a job, but I honestly didn’t find them that helpful - my career coach was nice and was good emotional support but didn’t help me get referrals and didn’t help me with technical interviews. Part of the issue is that I feel like there’s only so much they can do - the data science interview process is really like the Wild West, every company does the interview process differently and it’s tough to prepare. It felt like every company was looking for something different and it was impossible to be prepared for everything because there is just so much to know. About four months into my job search process the pandemic hit, and Springboard made a couple of major improvements to the job search program. The most important improvement they made is they created a Placements team that spend their time specifically looking for referrals and “ins” at companies for you. This was extremely helpful for me, and though the job I accepted was one that I found on my own and got through networking on my own, I got a few good referrals from this team. The second major improvement that they made was getting new mentors to help you with technical interviews. I got a job soon after I started speaking with my mentor, but I felt like he was very good and better than the mentor I had worked with in the past. Overall, a mixed experience with Springboard.

Save the Google searches for the projects, where most of the learning comes from anyway. The curriculum is also more up-to-date than an in-person program. The projects stretched me to my limits, and I came out a much better data scientist because of it. +	Course SupportThere has been an increase in course support over my time at Springboard. There is an option to have an additional mentorship meeting with a different mentor just to work on non-Capstone projects. Springboard also hosts an annual conference at their headquarters that is worth attending if you are a student. My student adviser provided great support along the way when I needed it.Negatives:-	Job SupportSpringboard is by no means a silver bullet to a dream data science job, but it’s close. You have to put in the work to landing a job to get that job afterwards. I found there were times where the career coaches were booked months in advance, but they seemed to have hired new staff. I have no doubt if you complete the course in six months that you would be ready for a DS role, but it’s an intense six months.- Completion TimeI took much longer than expected and was given extensions to finish. This was more a human error than a Springboard error, and if I felt mentally the way I do now compared to when I started Springboard, I could have easily finished in the allotted time. Just be careful with grandiose capstone projects.- FeedbackOutside of my mentor, I found feedback tough to get when handing in coursework. Overall: Great experience, would do again.

I think this is helpful, but could improve in many ways for 2020.1. More emphasis on deploying systems and system design. The curriculum delves very little into cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), preferring a more open-source based model. I think this is good in general, but machine learning engineers are inevitably going to be using one of these services in their careers. The course gives you credits for AWS, but little attention is paid in the curriculum to its use cases. Given all the time spent in the course, reading other paid material like Grokking the System Design Interview shouldn\'t be necessary if the curriculum is better formed. 2. Techniques other than machine learning. It\'s kind of ironic to ask a course like this to do something other than ML, but knowing when ML is useful and when other techniques are appropriate (from heuristics to Deep RL) does not really get much attention.3. More work on data collection. It would be much more helpful if the course explained more further up the pipeline on how to collect, ETL, and store data to make ML possible.

My impression is that the quality of one\'s experience with the program depends largely on the quality of one\'s mentor. My mentor was initially pretty poor, and I had a difficult time understanding his accent. But I reached out to Springboard early in the program, and they helped reassign me to a new mentor. Thankfully, my new mentor is excellent and has dramatically improved my experience. I\'m in a study group with other students, and I\'ve gotten the impression that their mentors are so-so. I have learned a lot so far in the program, and I\'ve been especially happy with Springboard\'s customer support (very friendly and helpful) and career support (they get you started on job stuff early on in the program). A fair portion of the data science curriculum (so far) has consisted of Datacamp exercises. Springboard partners with Datacamp, and students get free access to Datacamp courses. Honestly, I haven\'t been that impressed with the Datacamp courses. They are helpful for gaining superficial exposure to tools and skills used in data science, but they don\'t cultivate a deep understanding. I will say that the time estimates Springboard gives (completion in 6 months, working 15-20 hrs a week) are pretty unrealistic. Most of my study group (including me) is working on the course full time, and we are all on track to finish in 5 months (at the earliest), and probably more like 6 months. Unless you already have significant data science experience, don\'t expect to finish the program in under 5 months, and possibly even under 6 months.Overall, given my experience so far, I would probably recommend (pretty highly) Springboard\'s program to people (depending on their circumstances). I\'m happy to discuss my experience with people if anyone would like to know more, especially people with an academic background in the humanities.

If you end up with a mentor who isn\'t helpful, make the effort to communicate issues and give it a fair chance.

After completing you will be able to show your dedication to the field and have a couple of projects that you can show an employer demonstrating your abilities.

Other bootcamps charge $10,000+ for coursework that teaches the same principles over the same length of time. Additionally, springboard comes with a straight-forward job guarantee. The quality of the course material is repellent. I’m an avid learner and have taken many online courses through community colleges and state colleges. The amount of knowledge you gain and support you get from springboard makes universities look slow, petty, wasteful, unresourceful, and greedy. Much of the course material is drawn from online sources, but this is now common practice in higher academia. The coursework is highly informative and of sound quality (rivaling and surpassing the quality of a HCI course I took at PSU for example). What’s more, at the end of the career track you will also have a portfolio and a website platform to showcase all your work - critiqued by senior designer to make sure it looks right. And a CV and cover letter that is evaluated by those same designers. You also get a weekly one-on-one mentor throughout the length of the course. My mentor, Ciarda, tailored every session to my needs, was efficient beyond compare, and was always accessible. You can also schedule help from additional mentors whenever you need. Finally, the administration of springboard is flexible, personable, and does right by its students. I had the intention to complete the 6-month track within 3-months (I was on the month-to-month payment option so this would make the course $2,000 less for me). There were a few set-backs that pushed me a couple days past this deadline. The career track manager, Dave, very kindly worked with me through the obstacles to make sure everything worked out fairly. Going into it, I was worried a bootcamp might just be another form of degree-mill. The company isn’t about extorting students for money, but really wants to empower students to and earn a good name doing so. Way to go!

Now for the curriculum. This was sadly most dissappointing. The course mainly revolves around data camp courses. And then these are supplemented by youtube lectures from Harvard or other institutions that would talk about the subject with the impression that you have intermediate knowledge of the subject matter, despite it being a beginners intro video to a concept. I have had much better success with the self study resources available on the internet, such as youtube tutorials etc. Also did two Udemy courses for 11 dollars each and got a better understanding of the subjects.

What I liked the most about SB is that it is designed to be very resource-conscious, and even though they are an online program, you actually get a lot of one-to-one/real-life interaction. They are genuinely invested in your learning and success, and everyone I\'ve engaged with through the SB network—from the administrative staff to mentors to fellow coursemates—are really smart and supportive individuals. You don\'t get the impression that they are just running a business or scheming to milk your every dime. The entire experience was very human.The curriculum is also very thoughtfully designed. Even though at first I thought the idea of curated content rather than original content may be a downside, I have come to appreciate it. Because we are reading materials written by multiple people on similar subject matters, I have a better feel of the overall disciplinary discussions out there, and I feel like the knowledge is something I could confidently fall back on.Even though this is an online/remote program, I am glad to see that over time SB is investing in more in-person activities and interactions, such as onsite community events. One of the three projects we had to complete was an industry design project (IDP) where we get paired with a start-up to do real client work. My student advisor, Dave Weiner (Hi Dave...), thoughtfully paired me up with a company that works with education, since I came from academia myself. The office of the start-up was also located really close to where I live, so I actually got to visit the office and meet the team in real life. Because of this human thoughtfulness, the whole internship experience unfolded much more smoothly and successfully, and in the end, I got hired back as full-time staff without having to go through endless rounds of resume (re)writing, etc.The fact that the industry project turned into a real full-time position really helped me get the foot in the door (which is the hardest step really), so I don\'t take it lightly. But even without that luck, I do believe that in the current product job market, having real work experience is more important than learning of any shape and form, so having the IDP as one of the units was a huge advantage.

I also liked that all students get a mentor while they\'re doing the course, and Springboard was more affordable and shorter term than the other courses I looked at.

My mentor, Cari had a plethora of knowledge about the UX design field since she\'s done it for about 10+ years. She provided helpful constructive criticism on my assignments and my projects would come out more pristine and better aligned with the industry standards after receiving her feedback.Dave was an awesome student advisor and was always available to answer my course related questions.

It was at the same company my friend worked at and she encouraged me to apply. Springboard seriously prepared me for the interview process even though I was no where near the career prep section of the course (that\'s module 14).However, everything I learned up until section 8 helped me through the interview process, and Springboard\'s articles on Medium about preparing for interviews was also a life saver. The course in combination with the articles taught me how to explain my work and discuss the typical UX design process, since I had experience with that through the course.I was interview around 4 times, with different members of the team/recruiters which included an in person interview and I also had to do a design challenge which I was very nervous about but I took everything I learned so far in Springboard and applied it to the challenge.

Even those who have a research background such as Psychologists, Communication/Marketing (I have a BA in Communication) majors will also find the course helpful if they\'re looking to transition into UX, however, the UI Design section isn\'t as thorough in this course like in the UX Career Track, as this course is only 3-4 months long.If you\'re looking for a course that goes more in depth when it comes to UI design, the UX Design Career Track for Springboard might be a better option. That course is 6 months long with career coaching and a job guarantee, but the application process is much more extensive and the price is higher. You also have to have a previous design background to gain entry into that course so the UX Design course that I took might get your foot in the door.Overall, I\'m grateful for Springboard and all they have to offer.

Meanwhile the second project requires a bit more data cleaning, think along the lines of a kaggle competition.) then you follow up through weekly calls that keep you on point.Throughout the course you\'ll also learn how to better conduct your job search, interviews, and role targeting (Do you want to be a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, etc.). There is a job guarantee that gave me a lot of confidence while I was doing the course, it has a good amount of terms and conditions, but all of them are reasonable. They include but aren\'t limited to: Apply to 5 jobs a week, don\'t skip any interviews, etc. The career team works hard to make sure you get into a role that both fits your skill level, and your career goals. Let\'s say you want to be a Data Engineer and are quite suited to it, they won\'t push you to be a Data Analyst instead.One month after the completion of my course I was offered a Data Scientist position with a competitive salary (going to keep the number confidential but it was strong) in one of the regions of my choice (You choose 2-3 regions at the start of the course, I chose: Boston &amp; San Francisco) I could not be happier with my experience.Read Less','springboard'),(2808,246238,'A decent online course experience','2018-12-28',0,4,4,4,5,'The springboard UX Design online course is a cheap alternative to the in-person bootcamps.

The strongest aspect of the course are the mentors providing weekly coaching. I had three mentors throughout my Springboard courses, two of which had experience in the game development industry, which was important to me. One of my mentors did not have much experience in the industry and as a result I requested a change in mentors. This was the only negative experience I had with the course, and resulted in some duplicated work when I transitioned to my next mentor. Even though this mentor did not have game development experience, they had plenty of Fortune 500 UX knowledge and if my desired job was not so niche, I believe the mentor relationship would have been excellent. The curriculum has a relatively short beginner\'s guide to UX concepts before introducing the capstone project. The capstone will take up most of your time, and all of the small assignments build to this final project. I felt like the training content (largely through Lynda videos) was applicable and engaging. It helped to apply the ideas from the video directly to my project as I took notes. Having a capstone to constantly build on while studying these concepts provided constant motivation. My mentor also helped take concepts and apply them to my project. I found it easy to speed through sections I was already well versed in, and enjoyed being able to take my time in sections that were new to me. Something they don\'t mention in the on-boarding/ marketing material is that you also get a year\'s Lynda.com subscription with your Springboard course. This is a great resource to access if you have other disciplines you want to study.Overall, I\'d recommend this program with the caveat that if your mentor doesn\'t feel right for you in your gut don\'t feel afraid to contact Springboard support immediately and talk it out with them.

Read More to enter this field once I graduated. However, by sheer luck, I stumbled upon Springboard\'s online UX course and signed up. At the time, I hardly had any little knowledge of what UX was at all. Now, as a UX Designer at IBM, I cannot stress how pivotal this course in enabling me to jumpstart my career.Springboard uses an intuitive website to guide students through the various stages of designing a mobile application or website (which may conveniently enough be used as a portfolio piece). Utilizing a mixture of articles, interactive courses, and videos, I was able to gain a firm understanding of the different design research methodologies popular in the field. This was important on two fronts. Firstly, these techniques helped me design better applications, since tools like card sorts, interviews, and wireframings genuinely help you design better experiences and can be applied virtually anywhere. Secondly, the techniques I learnt served as buzzwords to those I interviewed with for UX Design roles that demonstrated my knowledge in the field.On top of this, there were two aspects that made this course truly successful. The first was the weekly Skype calls with a design mentor. At the start of the course, I was assigned a mentor who was a professional in the field. Once a week I could consult her with any questions about the coursework, or any career-related questions I had.

Read More in another language besides Python. Some Python tutorials were sufficient for applying to this bootcamp. CURRICULUM: Covers required basics, esp for data science interviews. Mostly based on pre-existing materials online, but Springboard does the legwork of sifting through the overwhelming sea of Internet resources and curating them into a chronological curriculum. Additionally, they’ve got their own resources, including lists of interview questions and networking how-to’s. These were immensely helpful. I also used the interview questions as a study guide, which paid off as several topics appeared in actual interviews. STAFF/MENTOR: Lots of support – you can schedule calls with a career coach, do mock interviews, and generally interact with other people in what could otherwise be an isolated journey of self-teaching. Incredibly professional and knowledgeable staff, very responsive customer support. I was also very happy with my mentor. The first one I was assigned to was a bit lackluster, but after having to postpone my start date, I ended up with another one. My weekly call with him helped me stay on track, and he was incredibly helpful and encouraging. This included post-bootcamp, when I sought his advice on choosing between jobs.CAPSTONE PROJECTS: Critical part of my resume, since I didn’t have industry experience or data sci projects where I used machine learning. Starting a project can be intimidating and unfamiliar, so the bootcamp provided me structure. Another Springboard staff member grades your project and provides feedback - I wish their comments/suggestions were more detailed though. COST: Steeper than I’d liked, but it paid off. I had the freedom to pursue this full-time, so I did the per-monthly plan hoping I’d complete it within 2-3 months. I ended up taking 4 months, but still avoided the heftier 6-month charge.JOB HUNT: Again, YMMV – like I suspect w/ many bootcamps out there. It’ll be up to you to do a lot of the networking. I reviewed my Springboard curriculum, plus lots of extra reading outside the curriculum (particularly practice tech &amp; behavioral questions). Also deployed one of my Springboard projects as a Flask web app. I went to events/Meetups, did informational phone calls w/ close and distant contacts, and applied to several jobs (requiring cover letters) each week. Overall: Good self-paced curriculum that covers the basics. Pricey, YMMV, but worth it for me ultimately.

The content of the course is an amalgamation of various sources online about UX design, from Lynda courses to Skillshare to articles on Medium and other sites. The quality of the materials tends to be great, though there are a few pieces that I skipped over. You only need to complete 60% of the course and all 13 projects in order to receive your certificate, so if you already feel well versed in an area then you can cut straight to the area\'s project and move on. I\'m excited for more of Springboard\'s in-person events, too! As of this review, they have hosted one conference/meet-up at their headquarters in San Francisco earlier in September, and meeting with other students, staff, an faculty really cemented for me that I chose the right course.

Read More course from Springboard. Have tried using many MOOC`s (massive online open courseware) to learn data science but to no use. Springboard`s mentor driven and community driven coursework is a lot better. Setting up the R Studio environment, Github, writing code on R, R markdown etc, all take quite some effort, if you are from a non computer science background (I am not a CS major but had some coding in high school and undergrad). This is where the mentor and community are most useful. The $ 500 per month fee is very reasonable for the community, mentor interactions and curriculum that you get in the course. My advice to prospective students who have no background in statistics and programming is as follows:1) First learn statistics from online resources like Khan Academy, Saylor.org etc. Topics may include descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, types of distributions, probability), inferential statistics (p-value, Z-scores, hypothesis test, t-test) and machine learning (linear regression, logistic regression, some simple classification algorithms etc). Even datacamp.com has many good coding courses built around statistics. 2) Learn some R, Python and SQL from datacamp.com. Take a total of 10 certificate courses from datacamp in these 3 programming languages. This will really help develop your coding skills. In R, take introduction to R, intermediate R, dplyr, ggplot, statistics with R etc. In Python, learn numpy, pandas, seaborn etc. 3) After you have finished above 2 points, you can move to Springboard. You may think that Springboard is also about the first 2 points. Yes, it is. But the most important part of Springboard is the capstone project. Once you have completed point 1 and 2, you can enter the Springboard foundations course confidently and spend most of your time thinking and working on your capstone project. Remember that nothing matches the skills you develop while completing an end to end capstone project.

Springboard does not make ANY of their own curriculum and they don\'t craft any tie-ins or connections between the different lessons. A large part of the curriculum is based off of Data Camp to learn R. Learning through Data Camp has it\'s own set of challenges and none of these are addressed by Springboard. Other components of the course include the EdX Analytics series and dplyr videos through Data School. Many of these resources are good on their own, but none is complete enough to give the student (or at least one w/o a coding background) sufficient foundation to tackle the assignments. Often the assignments are so disconnected from the curriculum, that they are difficult to complete w/o help for your mentor--which is OK to a degree, but given that each mentor session is 30 minutes--often time runs out before addressing the capstone and other project concerns. I really feel that more attention should be paid to the curriculum---it is certainly OK to use resources from other sites, but there should be reinforcement of key concepts like..writing functions...through either supplemental videos created by Springboard, or focus lessons during the office hours.With regard to job assistance--there is none and the career materials provided, again are brief You Tube video clips or books that are not presented in any kind of way to give the student a view of the field, options for careers or even guidance in terms of moving forward with skills, once one completes the course.
